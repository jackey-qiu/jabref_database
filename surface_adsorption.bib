	initio thermodn., bond valence calcns., and d. of states studies
	to investigate the chem. reactivity of Î±-Al2O3 and Î±-Fe2O3 (1102)
	surfaces in a humid environment. Isostructural Î±-Fe2O3 (1102) displays
	a much higher degree of surface reactivity with respect to water
	adsorption and aq. heavy metal ions than Î±-Al2O3. The reason for
	these differences was not fully explained. While both metal oxides
	exhibit a similar stable (1102) surface at and below room temp.,
	corresponding to a stoichiometric surface with the first layer of
	metal ions missing, the degree of hydroxylation of the surface O
	atoms leads to differences in the at. layer relaxation in Î±-Al2O3
	(1102) compared to Î±-Fe2O3 (1102), which was also confirmed previously
	by crystal truncation rod x-ray diffraction studies. Also in agreement
	with these exptl. studies, we find the at. layer spacing of the most
	energetically stable (11_02) Al2O3 surface is relatively insensitive
	to the inclusion of multiple layers of physisorbed water. This is
	in contrast to previously reported d. functional theory studies of
	hydrated (11_02) Î±-Fe2O3 surfaces, the results of which are confirmed
	in this work, that a monolayer of water is required for good agreement
	with exptl. measurements of the at. layer relaxation. These changes
	in at. spacing result in changes in electron charge distributions
	and in Lewis and Bronsted acid/base properties of surface sites,
	which influence the relative reactivities of the 2 surfaces. However,
	the higher reactivity of the hydrated (1102) surface of Î±-Fe2O3
	can be attributed mainly to the empty d states of the surface Fe
	atoms, which exhibit a first peak at âˆ¼1 eV above the Fermi level
	and act as very strong Lewis acid sites. In comparison, the empty
	p states of Al in the hydrated (1102) Î±-Al2O3 surface, which are
	âˆ¼5 eV above the Fermi level, should be much less reactive to potential
	adsorbates. [on SciFinder(R)]},

	change as a function of RH. At low relative humidity, below approximately
	10%, water adsorbs on the surface in an ordered fashion with the
	formation of a stable hydroxide layer. At intermediate RH, between
	10 and 70% RH, water adsorbs molecularly in a structured overlayer.
	At high RH, greater than 70%, water adsorption is more disordered
	and consistent with the formation of a liquid-like water layer. The

	batch adsorption experiments, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS),
	and surface complexation modeling. U(VI) uptake on imogolite surfaces

	sodium nitrate concentration in the range from 0.02 to 0.5&#xa0;M.
	XAS analyses show that two U(VI) inner-sphere (bidentate mononuclear
	coordination on outer-wall aluminol groups) and one outer-sphere
	surface species are present on the imogolite surface, and the distribution
	of the surface species is pH dependent. At pH 8.8, bis-carbonato
	inner-sphere and tris-carbonato outer-sphere surface species are
	present. At pH 7, bis- and non-carbonato inner-sphere surface species
	co-exist, and the fraction of bis-carbonato species increases slightly
	with increasing I (0.1â€“0.5&#xa0;M). At pH 5.3, U(VI) non-carbonato
	bidentate mononuclear surface species predominate (69%). A triple
	layer surface complexation model was developed with surface species
	that are consistent with the XAS analyses and macroscopic adsorption
	data. The proton stoichiometry of surface reactions was determined
	from both the pH dependence of U(VI) adsorption data in pH regions
	of surface species predominance and from bond-valence calculations.
	The bis-carbonato species required a distribution of surface charge
	between the surface and Î² charge planes in order to be consistent
	with both the spectroscopic and macroscopic adsorption data. This
	research indicates that U(VI)-carbonato ternary species on poorly

	The competitive effect of carbonate increased with increasing CO2

	sorption was reduced by carbonate only at slightly acidic to neutral
	pH values, whereas arsenite sorption was decreased across the entire

	cycling take place at the interface between minerals and aqueous

	requires knowledge of the structure of mineralâ€“water interfaces.
	High-resolution specular X-ray reflectivity was used to determine
	the structure of the hematite (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)â€“water interface.
	Relaxation of the surface was observed to be minor, and water was
	found to order near the hematite surface. Two sites of adsorbed water
	are inferred to be ordered laterally, one bridging between triply
	coordinated functional groups and the other bridging between the
	singly coordinated functional groups on the surface, as steric constraints
	limit the possible arrangements of water molecules occurring at the
	observed heights above the hematite surface. Relaxations of the hematite
	and corundum (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) surfaces, which are isostructural,
	are similar and limited primarily to the top most layer of the structures.
	No significant changes to the interfacial stoichiometry (i.e., partial
	occupancy of surface species) are observed in either case. The structure
	of interfacial water is similar on the hematite and corundum (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)
	surfaces as well, although water appeared to be less well ordered
	on the hematite surface. This may be due to expected differences
	in the oxygen exchange rates from surface functional groups or the
	apparent better matching of the corundum oxygen lattice to the natural
	structural ordering in water, and suggests that the dielectric constant
	gradients of interfacial water may differ on the two surfaces. Similar

	of surface functional groups are exposed. Although generally similar,
	subtle differences in the reactivity of hematite and corundum (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)

  abstract = {The fate of the oxoanion arsenate in diverse systems is strongly affected
	by its adsorption on the surfaces of iron (oxyhydr)oxide minerals.
	Predicting this behavior in the environment requires an understanding
	of the mechanisms of arsenate adsorption. In this study, the binding
	site and adsorption geometry of arsenate on the hematite (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)
	surface is investigated. The structure and termination of the hematite
	(0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)-water interface were determined by high resolution
	X-ray reflectivity, revealing that two distinct terminations exist
	in a roughly 3:1 proportion. The occurrence of multiple terminations
	appears to be a result of sample preparation, and is not intrinsic
	to the hematite (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) surface. X-ray standing wave (XSW)
	measurements were used to determine the registry of adsorbed arsenate
	to the hematite structure, and thus the binding site and geometry
	of the resulting surface complex. Arsenate forms a bridging bidentate
	complex on two adjacent singly coordinated oxygen groups on each
	of the two distinct terminations present at the hematite surface.
	Although this geometry is consistent with that seen in past studies,
	the derived Asâ€“Fe distances are longer, the result of the topology
	of the FeO6 octahedra on the (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) surface. As EXAFS-derived
	Asâ€“Fe distances are often used to determine the adsorption mechanism
	in environmental samples (e.g., mine tailings, contaminated sediments),
	this demonstrates the importance of considering the possible sorbent
	surface structures and arrangements of adsorbates when interpreting
	such data. As multiple functional groups are present and multiple
	binding geometries are possible on the hematite (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)
	surface, the XSW data suggest that formation of bridging bidentate
	surface complexes on singly coordinated oxygen sites is the preferred
	adsorption mechanism on this and most other hematite surfaces (provided
	those surfaces contain adjacent singly coordinated oxygen groups).
	These measurements also constrain the likely reaction stoichiometry,
	with only the protonation state of the surface complex undetermined.
	Although bridging bidentate inner-sphere surface complexes comprised
	the majority of the adsorbed arsenate present on the hematite (0&#xa0;1&#xa0;2)
	surface, there is an additional population of sorbed arsenate species
	that could not be characterized by the XSW measurements. These species
	are likely more disordered, and thus more weakly bound, than the
	bridging bidentate complexes, and may play a role in determining
	the fate, transport, and bioavailability of arsenate in the environment.
	Finally, the possibility of obtaining species-specific XSW measurements
	by tuning the incident beam energy to specific features in a XANES
	spectrum is described.},

	of the properties of lead(II) compounds motivated partly by the necessity
	of understanding the Pb(II) binding preferences for the design of
	selective chelation therapy agents [2–6] and remediation of waters
	and soils.
	
	
	Another topic of interest is associated with the occurrence in Pb(II)
	compounds of a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons (LP,
	E) and its effect on the stereochemistry and properties of solid-state
	lead(II)-containing materials

	ligand atoms are directed throughout the surface of an encompassing
	globe” and “hemidirected, in which the bonds to ligand atoms are

	identiﬁable void (or gap) in the distribution of bonds to the ligands”.
	
	
	#VSEPR

	enables one to predict and determine the geometry of molecules and
	complexes of different metals, including those with a LP.
	
	
	#geometry of AX3E
	
	The molecules and complexes of composition AX3E (CN A (3 + E)) (E:
	lone pair of electrons) have a trigonal-pyramidal geometry with the
	metal atom in the apical vertex. The coordination polyhedron of the
	A atom is predicted to have a -tetrahedral conﬁguration (I) with
	the X–Pb–X angle less than an ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 ◦
	
	
	Among the 98 crystal structures of Pb(II) complexes with O-donor ligands
	investigated in this work, only the structures of 10 compounds (12
	types of Pb atoms) contain the Pb(II) atom with the CN (3 + E) +m
	and the -tetrahedral coordination geometry (Table 8). The lengths
	of the primary Pb–O bonds in Pb(II) complexes with CN (3 + E) +m
	fall into the range 2.25–2.53 Å with the average value of 2.40 Å.
	The values of the bond angles O–Pb–O vary in the range 68.37–88.88
	◦ (Tables 2-6), much less than the value of the bond angle in an
	ideal tetrahedron (109.5◦), conﬁrming a -tetrahedral coordination
	geometry of the Pb(II) atom in these compounds.
	
	
	#geometry of AX4E
	
	Structures of Pb(II) complexes where the Pb atom has CN (4 + E) +m
	should have a -trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry according
	to the VSEPR model. Among the studied crystal structures, complexes
	with O-donor ligands and CN (4 + E) +m are highly represented (54
	structures) (Table 9). Due to the effect of the stereochemically
	active lone pair, the axial lengths Pb–Oax in the - trigonal bipyramidal
	coordination polyhedra of Pb atoms are larger than the equatorial
	bond lengths while the values of the axial and equatorial angles
	become less than 180 ◦ and 120 ◦ as expected for a
	
	regular trigonal bipyramid. As seen from Tables 2–6, the structural
	parameters of the Pb atoms with CN (4 + E) +m are in full agreement
	with the VSEPR model for the -trigonal-bipyramidal coordination
	geometry.
	
	
	#Van der Waals radii of pb-o
	
	According to Bondi [29], the sum of the van der Waals radii of Pb
	and O is equal to 3.54 Å. In the present work the limiting value
	for a Pb–O bond is considered as 3.30 Å.
	
	
	The large Pb2+ ionic radius (1.19 Å [29]) facilitates the formation
	of compounds with CNs of the central atom ranging from 2 up to 12
	[15].
	
	
	#primary and secondary bond
	
	The common feature of the crystal structures of Pb(II) complexes with
	O-donor atom ligands and the stereochemically active lone pair of
	electrons is the presence of two ranges of Pb–O bond lengths in these
	complexes, the so-called primary and secondary bonds. The primary
	bonds have a large share of covalent character (donor–acceptor) while
	the secondary bonds are to a great extent ionic, in most cases they
	are bridging and serve to unite complexes into chains, layers or
	three-dimensional networks.
	
	
	Based on the presence of two Pb–O bond length ranges in the structures
	of Pb(II) complexes, the CN of the Pb atom in these complexes can
	be divided into two components: the CN of the Pb atomof the ﬁrst

	with surface complexation model (SCM) development to predict trace
	metal speciation and partitioning in aqueous systems over a broad
	range of conditions. In this work, an extensive collection of new
	macroscopic and spectroscopic data was used to assess the ability
	of the modified triple-layer model (TLM) to predict single-solute
	lead(II) [Pb(II)] sorption onto 2-line ferrihydrite in NaNO3 solutions
	as a function of pH, ionic strength, and concentration. Regression
	of constant-pH isotherm data together with potentiometric titration
	and pH edge data was a much more rigorous test of the TLM than fitting
	pH edge data alone. When combined with spectroscopic data, the choices
	of feasible surface species/site types were limited to a few. In
	agreement with the spectroscopic data, very good fits of the isotherm
	data were obtained with a two-species, one-site model using the bidentate-mononuclear/monodentate-mononuclear
	species pairs, (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOHPb2+ and (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOPb+âˆ’NO3-.
	Regressing edge data in the absence of isotherm and spectroscopic
	data resulted in a fair number of surface-species/site-type combinations
	that provided acceptable fits of the edge data but unacceptable fits
	of the isotherm data. Surprisingly, best-fit equilibrium â€œconstantsâ€�
	for the Pb(II) surface complexes required adjustment outside the
	pH range of 4.5âˆ’5.5 in order to fit the isotherm data. In addition,
	a surface activity term was needed to reduce the ionic strength dependence
	of sorption for the species pair, (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOHPb2+. In light
	of this, the ability of existing SCMs to predict Pb(II) sorption
	onto 2-line ferrihydrite over a wide range of conditions seems questionable.
	While many advances have been made over the past decade, much work
	still needs to be done in fine-tuning the thermodynamic framework

  abstract = {The iron oxide–water interface is of interest not only in geochemical
	and environmental processes, but also in fields ranging from corrosion
	to photocatalysis. The structure of α-Fe2O3 (001) surfaces is not
	fully understood, and questions have arisen recently concerning different
	terminations of (001) terraces; a so-called Fe-termination is expected,
	but under some conditions an O-termination may also be possible.
	Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) studies
	report evidence for an O-termination in coexistence with an Fe-termination,
	but other studies find no evidence for an O-termination. Molecular
	mechanics studies suggest that an O-termination should be possible
	in an aqueous environment. An O-termination could result from dissolution;
	if Fe atoms were to dissolve from an Fe-termination, an O-termination
	would presumably result (and vice-versa). We imaged hematite (001)
	surfaces in air and aqueous solution using STM. To aid interpretation
	of the images, we use a resonant tunneling model (RTM) parameterized
	using ab initio calculations.
	
	Our STM and RTM results are consistent with mixed O- and Fe-terminated
	(001) surfaces. For acid-etched surfaces we find evidence for a periodic
	(with wavelength of 2.2 ± 0.2 nm) arrangement of nominal O- and Fe-terminated
	domains. Two different borders between domains should occur, one
	in which the Fe-termination is high relative to the O-termination,
	and the reverse. The different domain borders have significantly
	different heights, consistent with RTM calculations. This agreement
	allows us to conclude that the Fe-termination is topographically
	high on most terraces. Surface domains are observed in aqueous solutions
	at the atomic scale, and appear to be very unreactive on tens-of-seconds
	time scales at pH 1.},

  abstract = {Goethite(Î±-FeOOH), an abundant and highly reactive iron oxyhydroxide
	mineral, has been the subject of numerous studies of environmental
	interface reactivity. However, such studies have been hampered by
	the lack of experimental constraints on aqueous interface structure,
	and especially of the surface water molecular arrangements. Structural
	information of this type is crucial because reactivity is dictated
	by the nature of the surface functional groups and the structure
	or distribution of water and electrolyte at the solid-solution interface.
	In this study we have investigated the goethite (1&#xa0;0&#xa0;0)
	surface using surface diffraction techniques, and have determined
	the relaxed surface structure, the surface functional groups, and
	the three dimensional nature of two distinct sorbed water layers.
	The crystal truncation rod (CTR) results show that the interface
	structure consists of a double hydroxyl, double water terminated
	interface with significant atom relaxations. Further, the double
	hydroxyl terminated surface dominates with an 89% contribution having
	a chiral subdomain structure on the (1&#xa0;0&#xa0;0) cleavage faces.
	The proposed interface stoichiometry is ((H2O)(H2O)OH2OHFeOOFeR)
	with two types of terminal hydroxyls; a bidentate (B-type) hydroxo
	group and a monodentate (A-type) aquo group. Using the bond-valence
	approach the protonation states of the terminal hydroxyls are predicted
	to be OH type (bidentate hydroxyl with oxygen coupled to two Fe3+
	ions) and OH2 type (monodentate hydroxyl with oxygen tied to only
	one Fe3+). A double layer three dimensional ordered water structure
	at the interface was determined from refinement of fits to the experimental
	data. Application of bond-valence constraints to the terminal hydroxyls
	with appropriate rotation of the water dipole moments allowed a plausible
	dipole orientation model as predicted. The structural results are
	discussed in terms of protonation and H-bonding at the interface,

  abstract = {Sorption of Zn(II)(aq) on hematite (Î±-Fe2O3) nanoparticles (average
	diameter 10.5 nm) and microparticles (average diameter 550 nm) has
	been examined over a range of total Zn(II)(aq) concentrations (0.4?7.6
	mM) using Zn K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy and selective chemical extractions.
	When ZnCl2 aqueous solutions were reacted with hematite nanoparticles
	(HN) at pH 5.5, Zn(II) formed a mixture of four- and six-coordinated
	surface complexes [Zn(O,OH)4 and Zn(O,OH)6] with an average Zn?O
	distance of 2.04 Â± 0.02 Ã… at low sorption densities (Î“ â‰¤ 1.1
	?mol/m2). On the basis of EXAFS-derived Zn?Fe3+ distances of (3.10?3.12)
	Â± 0.02 Ã…, we conclude that both Zn(O,OH)6 and Zn(O,OH)4 adsorb
	on octahedral Fe3+(O,OH)6 or pentahedral Fe3+(O,OH)5 surface sites
	on HN as inner-sphere, mononuclear, bidentate, edge-sharing adsorption
	complexes at these low sorption densities. It is possible that polynuclear
	Zn complexes are also present because of the similarity of Zn and
	Fe backscattering. At higher Zn(II) sorption densities on hematite
	nanoparticles (Î“ â‰¥ 3.38 ?mol/m2), we observed the formation of
	Zn(O,OH)6 surface complexes, with an average Zn?O distance of 2.09
	Â± 0.02 Ã…, a Zn?Zn distance of 3.16 Â± 0.02 Ã…, and a linear multiple-scattering
	feature at 6.12 Â± 0.06 Ã…. Formation of a Zn(OH)2(am) precipitate
	for the higher sorption density samples (Î“ â‰¥ 3.38 ?mol/m2) is
	suggested on the basis of comparison of the EXAFS spectra of the
	sorption samples with that of synthetic Zn(OH)2(am). In contrast,
	EXAFS spectra of Zn(II) sorbed on hematite microparticles (HM) under
	similar experimental conditions showed no evidence of surface precipitates
	even at the same total [Zn(II)(aq)] that resulted in precipitate
	formation in the nanoparticle system. Instead, Zn(O,OH)6 octahedra
	(d(Zn?O) = 2.10 Â± 0.02 Ã…) were found to sorb dominantly in an inner-sphere,
	bidentate, edge-sharing fashion on Fe3+(O,OH)6 octahedra at hematite
	microparticle surfaces, based on an EXAFS-derived Zn?Fe3+ distance

	of bond valence, in combination with the number of coordinating (Me

	neutralization of an oxygen by Me ion(s) is calculated on the basis

	controlling factor in interfacial reactions such as foreign ion incorporation,

	simulations with four different models based on interatomic potentials
	have been carried out to determine the atomic-level structure of
	three hematiteâ€“water interfaces. In addition, for each of the three
	surfaces, different terminations or protonation schemes were considered.
	The availability of surface X-ray scattering data for the surfaces
	considered here allowed for an extensive comparison with experimental
	data. Qualitatively, with the exception of one termination with one
	model, all models predict the correct arrangement of water molecules
	at the interface. Quantitatively, the agreement with experimental
	positions, distances, and layer occupancies is good to excellent,

	studies. Therefore, this study provides further evidence that interatomic
	potential models can be used to reliably predict the structure of
	mineralâ€“water interfaces. In addition, molecular simulations are
	a valuable source of information to complement surface X-ray scattering
	experiments owing to their ability to directly determine the position
	of hydrogen atoms and to yield three-dimensional predicted structures

  abstract = {Potentiometric titration studies on a pristine goethite suspension
	(Î±-FeOOH) have suggested alternative surface complexation model
	(SCM) parameters to those currently in use. It is proposed that the

	be higher than usually reported and the inner-layer capacitance in
	the region of 0.4-0.8 F m-2 for ionic strengths of 10-3-10-1M. The
	study demonstrates that some surface complexation model (SCM) parameters
	may be incorrect due to an experimental artifact, though they give
	good simulations of experimental data. This may be due to the success
	of least-squares fitting programs such as FITEQL at finding model
	parameters to describe experimental data sets. Previous studies have
	shown that goethite (Î±-FeOOH) suspensions purged with CO2-free N2(g)

	(PZNPC) in the range 9.0-9.3, which is close to a theoretical value

	as the two intrinsic surface acidity constants pKinta1 and pKinta2

	sets in which the PZNPC was in the range 7.35-8.65. This study reports
	a set of surface complexation model parameters determined from potentiometric

	for 2 months. Parameters were calculated using the computer program
	FITEQL within the context of three commonly used models, the diffuse

	to immobilization of arsenite (AsO33âˆ’), the reduced, highly toxic
	form of arsenic in contaminated anoxic groundwaters, as well as to
	putative remediation processes. Nanocrystalline magnetite (<20 nm)
	is known to exhibit higher efficiency for arsenite sorption than
	larger particles, sorbing as much as âˆ¼20 Î¼mol/m2 of arsenite.
	To improve our understanding of this process, we investigated the
	molecular level structure of As(III)-containing sorption products
	on two types of fine-grained magnetite: (1) a biogenic one with an
	average particle diameter of 34 nm produced by reduction of lepidocrocite
	(Î³-FeOOH) by Shewanella putrefaciens and (2) a synthetic, abiotic,
	nanocrystalline magnetite with an average particle diameter of 11
	nm. Results from extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) for
	both types of magnetite with As(III) surface coverages of up to 5
	Î¼mol/m2 indicate that As(III) forms dominantly inner-sphere, tridentate,
	hexanuclear, corner-sharing surface complexes (3C) in which AsO3
	pyramids occupy vacant tetrahedral sites on octahedrally terminated
	{111} surfaces of magnetite. Formation of this type of surface complex
	results in a decrease in dissolved As(III) concentration below the
	maximum concentration level recommended by the World Health Organization
	(10 Î¼g/L), which corresponds to As(III) surface coverages of 0.16
	and 0.19 Î¼mol/m2 in our experiments. In addition, high-resolution
	transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive
	X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analyses revealed the occurrence of an
	amorphous As(III)-rich surface precipitate forming at As(III) surface
	coverages as low as 1.61 Î¼mol/m2. This phase hosts the majority
	of adsorbed arsenite at surface coverages exceeding the theoretical
	maximum site density of vacant tetrahedral sites on the magnetite
	{111} surface (3.2 sites/nm2 or 5.3 Î¼mol/m2). This finding helps
	to explain the exceptional As(III) sorption capacity of nanocrystalline
	magnetite particles (>10 Î¼mol/m2). However, the higher solubility
	of the amorphous surface precipitate compared to the 3C surface complexes
	causes a dramatic increase of dissolved As concentration for coverages

  review = {#lead complexation in general:
	
	Lead(II) may either form hemidirected complexes with large bond distance
	distribution and an apparent gap for excess electron density, or
	holodirected ones with a symmetric coordination sphere with normal
	bond distance distribution, depending on the strength of antibonding
	lead 6s/ligand np molecular orbital interactions and ligand-ligand
	interactions.
	
	
	EXAFS data on the hydrated lead(II) ion in aqueous solution show broad
	bond distance distribution and a lack of inner-core multiple scattering
	contributions strongly indicating a hemidirected structure.
	
	
	The Pb-O bond distances found both by EXAFS and LAXS, 2.54(1) A˚ ,
	point to a six-coordinate hydrated lead(II) ion in hemidirected fashion
	with an unevenly distributed electron density.
	
	
	#why pb(II) is more dominant in environment than pb(IV):
	
	The tendency of the heavier main group elements to adopt an oxidation
	state two steps below the highest possible oxidation state has been
	attributed to the effect of the so-called “inert electron-pair”.
	This property was explained by the relativistic stabilization of
	the 6s orbital, caused by the direct relativistic effect and the
	presence of the filled 4f subshell.
	
	
	#The broad range of coordination numbers from 2 to 12 exhibited by
	lead(II), if counting all nearest neighbors, results in a large variety
	of configurations of its complexes and compounds
	
	
	#about inert electron-pair theory
	
	According to the valence bond theory, the inert electron-pair can
	either occupy a hybrid orbital formed by mixing the 6s and 6p orbitals
	on the metal ion and as such becoming stereochemically active, or
	be a pure s 2 electronpair and thereby stereochemically inactive.
	
	
	However, according to molecular orbital theory the classical conception
	of 6s/6p orbital hybridization on the lead(II) ion is regarded as
	incorrect. This is because the energy levels of these orbitals are
	too dissimilar, and the different spatial distribution of their corresponding
	wave functions.
	
	Instead, the stereochemical activity observed in lead(II) complexes
	should be seen as a result of an antibonding lead 6s-ligand np (6s/np)
	interaction
	
	which causes structural distortions to energetically minimize these
	unfavorable covalent interactions.
	
	
	Two general structural types of lead(II) complexes are identified,
	hemidirected and holodirected. In the former, the electron distribution
	around the
	
	metal ion is greatly unevenly distributed, caused by antibonding metal-ligand
	interactions creating a visual gap in the coordination sphere, while
	in the latter the electron distribution, as well as the coordination
	sphere, is symmetric.
	
	
	For 4- and 5-coordinate lead(II) complexes only hemidirected complexes
	are known, and for coordination numbers larger than eight no difference
	in ionic radius between hemi and holodirectionality can be distinguished.
	
	
	The wide bond distance distribution in the hemidirected complexes
	is well explained by the recent proposed MO theory where the metal-ligand
	
	bonds form antibonding covalent interactions.
	
	
	#lead(II) hydrolysis
	
	The primary products of hydrolysis are the mononuclear [Pb(OH)] +
	complex (pKa = 7.9) in dilute solutions and the tetranuclear [Pb4(OH)4]
	4+ complex in more concentrated ones.
	
	
	Also, the composition of the dominating polynuclear lead(II) hydrolysis
	complexes changes with increasing pH: [Pb4(OH)4] 4þ , [Pb3(OH)4]
	2þ , and
	
	[Pb6O(OH)6] 4þ , in the pH range 5-8.5, respectively.
	
	
	The lead(II) ion is weakly hydrated because of its low charge density.
	
	
	the expected holodirected Pb-O bond distance in six- and eight-coordination
	is 2.50 and 2.62 A˚, respectively, while the hemidirected Pb-O bond
	
	distance in six-coordination is 2.55 A˚.
	
	The experimental results together with the mean bond distance and
	the width of the bond distance distribution indicate that the hydrated
	lead(II) ion in aqueous solution is six-coordinate in hemidirected
	fashion.},

	SPC/E water at 298 K and 1 atm and for negatively charged surfaces
	in contact with SPC/E water containing dissolved electrolyte ions
	(Rb+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Na+, Ca2+, Cl-). Both hydroxylated (dissociative)
	and nonhydroxylated (associative) surfaces are simulated, since both
	types of water−surface interactions have been postulated from ab

	The positions of water molecules at the interface were found to be
	very similar for both hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated surfaces,

	occupying the site above each terminal titanium atom. Beyond these
	surface oxygens, a single additional layer of adsorbed water molecules

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to characterize
	the microstructure of the interface between aqueous solutions and

	surfaces, each either neutral or negatively charged. The fully atomistic
	description of the rutile surface and its interactions with the fluid
	phase was based on ab initio calculations, while the aqueous phase
	was described by the SPC/E model and existing parametrizations for
	Rb+, Na+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Cl- ions. Formation of inner-sphere
	complexes of cations with surface oxygens was identified for all
	cations studied. On negatively charged surfaces, Zn2+ is shown to
	sorb at two bidentate sites, between a bridging and terminal oxygen,
	and between two terminal oxygens (hydroxylated surface only), while
	all other cations occupy a tetradentate site, in contact with two
	terminal and two bridging oxygens in adjacent rows on the crystal
	surface, and directly above an additional triply coordinated oxygen
	in the Ti−O surface plane. These differences in inner-sphere binding
	configuration appear to be related to the bare ionic radii of the
	cations. Simulation results agree very well with X-ray standing wave
	and crystal truncation rod studies of the inner-sphere adsorption
	sites of the cations Rb+ and Sr2+. MD and X-ray results for Zn2+
	adsorption are qualitatively consistent, but important differences
	in adsorption heights are discussed. Both MD simulations and X-ray
	studies indicate that, on rutile (110), interaction of Cl- with neutral
	and negatively charged surfaces and with sorbed, multivalent cations
	is minimal. The hydroxylated surface gives better agreement with
	experiments than the nonhydroxylated surface and is therefore inferred
	to be the dominant surface in contact with aqueous solutions at ambient
	conditions. At the negative, hydroxylated surface, the MD results
	indicate that Sr2+ and Ca2+ also form outer-sphere species that are
	laterally ordered with respect to the crystal surface structure,
	though these are much less abundant than the inner-sphere species.
	At positively charged hydroxylated surfaces, MD simulations indicate
	Cl- adsorption in the tetradentate site 4.3 Å above the surface,
	with longer-range ordering of ions and water molecules than was observed
	on neutral or negatively charged surfaces. The adsorption geometries

  abstract = {Experimental determinations of the atomic structure of insulating
	oxide surfaces and metal/oxide interfaces are scarce, because surface
	science techniques are often limited by the insulating character
	of the substrate. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS), which
	is not subject to charge effects, can provide very precise information
	on the atomic structure of oxide surfaces: roughness, relaxation
	and reconstruction. It is also well adapted to analyze the atomic
	structure, the registry, the misfit relaxation, elastic or plastic,
	the growth mode and the morphology of metal/oxide interfaces during
	their growth, performed in situ. GIXS also allows the analysis of
	thin films and buried interfaces, in a non-destructive way, yielding
	the epitaxial relationships, and, by variation of the grazing incidence
	angle, the lattice parameter relaxation along the growth direction.
	On semi-coherent interfaces, the existence of an ordered network
	of interfacial misfit dislocations can be demonstrated, its Burger's
	vector determined, its ordering during in situ annealing cycles followed,
	and sometimes even its atomic structure can be addressed. Careful
	analysis during growth allows the modeling of the dislocation nucleation
	process.
	
	This review emphasizes the new information that GIXS can bring to
	oxide surfaces and metal/oxide interfaces by comparison with other
	surface science techniques. The principles of X-ray diffraction by
	surfaces and interfaces are recalled, together with the advantages
	and properties of grazing angles. The specific experimental requirements
	are discussed. Recent results are presented on the determination
	of the atomic structure of relaxed or reconstructed oxide surfaces.
	A description of results obtained during the in situ growth of metal
	on oxide surfaces is also given, as well as investigations of thick
	metal films on oxide surfaces, with lattice parameter misfit relaxed
	by an array of dislocations. Recent work performed on oxide thin
	films having important physical properties such as superconductivity
	or magnetism is also briefly reviewed.
	
	The strengths and limitations of the technique, such as the need for
	single crystals and surfaces of high crystalline quality are discussed.
	Finally, an outlook of future prospects in the field is given, such
	as the study of more complex oxide surfaces, vicinal surfaces, reactive
	metal/oxide interfaces, metal oxidation processes, the use of surfactants
	to promote wetting of a metal deposited on an oxide surface or the
	study of oxide/liquid interfaces in a non-UHV environment.},

	#INERT-PAIR EFFECT
	
	This term refers to the resistance of the pair of outer electrons
	on Pb(II) to removal or to participation in covalent bond formation
	or hydrogen bonding.
	
	It has been explained as a relativistic effect causing the 6s orbital
	to contract, thereby increasing the energy required to remove or
	interact with the 6s lone pair of electrons. On the other hand, the
	d and f orbitals are destabilized because they expand radially as
	a result of screening from nuclear attraction by the s and p electrons.
	The result is a stable, relatively inert outer lone pair of electrons.
	
	
	This lone pair of electrons can cause a nonspherical charge distribution
	around the Pb(II) cation, that is, the disposition of ligands around
	the cation results in an identifiable void. This gap in the coordination
	sphere has been considered evidence of a “stereochemically active
	lone pair of electrons” which
	
	probably takes up more space on a specific region of the surface of
	the coordination sphere than does a single bond.
	
	
	In this structure, all six Pb II-N distances are equal and the lone
	pair of electrons has no apparent directional effects on the angular
	distribution of the ligands or on the lead-ligand distances.
	
	
	When this Pb II-lp distance is large, the coordination is viewed as
	hemidirected because PbII-X bonds in one direction are very much
	shorter than those in the opposite direction. (even the ligands looks
	evenly distributing around the pb atom, take a look at scheme2)
	
	
	#electron transfer
	
	a greater transfer of electron density from the ligands to the lead
	as the electronegativity of the ligand decreases.The transfer of
	electrons is primarily into the 6p orbitals on the lead.
	
	The primary structural consequence of the greater lead p population
	is a decrease in the exterior X-PbII-X angle, suggesting some tendency
	toward a more tetrahedral (holodirected) arrangement of the ligands
	around the lead.
	
	The lone pair Pb(II) orbital consistently has greater p character
	when the ligands are charged.

	has received extensive theoretical study, due to the importance of
	this interface in electrochemistry and other sciences. Such studies
	suggest that adjacent to the interface water is arranged in several
	layers, that the molecular arrangements in the inner layer is similar
	to bulk water, and that the inner-layer molecules have an oxygen-up
	(oxygen-down) average orientation for negative (positive) electrode
	charge (or, equivalently, potential). However, little of this has
	been verified by experimental measurements. In this paper we report
	surface X-ray scattering measurements of the water distribution perpendicular
	to a Ag(111)-electrolyte interface in 0.1M NaF at two potentials:
	+0.52 and −0.23 V from the potential of zero charge (PZC) on the
	electrode. We find that, first, the water is ordered in layers extending
	about three molecular diameters from the electrode. Second, the extent
	of ordering and the distance between the electrode and first water
	layer depend on potential, the latter being consistent with an oxygen-up
	(oxygen-down) average molecular orientation for negative (positive)
	electrode potential. Third, the inner water layer contains 1.55 ×
	1015 (at −0.23 V) and 2.6 × 1015 (at +0.52 V) water molecules per
	cm−2, remarkably more than expected from the bulk water density (i.e.,
	∼ 1.15 × 1015cm−2). Such a large compression shows that the molecular
	arrangements in the inner layer are significantly different from
	bulk, which has not been anticipated in current models of charged,
	aqueous interfaces. We give a qualitative explanation of this large
	density as resulting from the strong electric field at the charged
	Ag(111) electrode and present a tentative model of the molecular
	arrangements.},

  abstract = { The structure of water at the (110) surface of cassiterite (α-SnO2)
	at ambient conditions was studied by means of molecular dynamics
	simulations and X-ray crystal truncation rod experiments and interpreted
	with the help of the revised MUSIC model of surface protonation.
	The interactions of the metal oxide in the simulations were described
	by a recently developed classical force field based on the SPC/E
	model of water. Two extreme cases of completely hydroxylated and
	nonhydroxylated surfaces were considered along with a mixed surface
	with 50% dissociation. To study the dependence of the surface properties
	on pH, neutral and negatively charged variants of the surfaces were
	constructed. Axial and lateral density distributions of water for
	different types of surfaces were compared to each other and to experimental
	axial density distributions found by X-ray experiments. Although
	significant differences were found between the structures of the
	studied interfaces, the axial distances between Sn and O atoms are
	very similar and therefore could not be clearly distinguished by
	the diffraction technique. The explanation of structures observed
	in the density distributions was provided by a detailed analysis
	of hydrogen bonding in the interfacial region. It revealed qualitatively
	different hydrating patterns formed at neutral hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated
	surfaces and suggested a preference for the dissociative adsorption
	of water. At negatively charged surfaces, however, the situation
	can be reversed by the electric field stabilizing a hydrogen bond
	network similar to that found at the neutral nonhydroxylated surface.
	Comparison with previously studied rutile (α-TiO2) surfaces provided
	insight into the differences between the hydration of these two metal
	oxides, and an important role was ascribed to their different lattice
	parameters. A link to macroscopic properties was provided by the
	revised MUSIC surface protonation model. Explicit use of the Sn−O
	bond lengths based on ab initio calculations and H-bond configurations
	as inputs led to the prediction of a pH of zero net-proton induced
	surface charge (pHpzc) that agrees very well with those determined
	experimentally (about 4.4 at 298 K). },

  abstract = {Arsenate and silicate are tetrahedral anions that strongly sorb to
	positive Fe oxide surfaces over the pH range 2â€“7. Both are important
	agents for modification of Fe oxide surface reactivity, and notably
	passivate against other sorption reactions. Arsenate is a significant
	health hazard as a sorbed pollutant associated with acid mine drainage,
	while silicate is a common anion in natural solutions. Our aim is
	to understand the types of sorption complexes that form with these
	anions on different crystal faces, and whether polymerization occurs
	with the silicate units. Silicate polymerization could dramatically
	alter Fe oxide surface reactivity. The structural characterization
	is conducted using both grazing incidence extended X-ray absorption
	fine structure (GIEXAFS) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
	(SSRL) and the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), and surface
	diffraction (using crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis) at the
	Advanced Photon Source (APS). GIEXAFS yields interatomic distances
	from arsenic and silicon to their oxygen first neighbor shell and
	second Fe or other next neighbor shell, and thus allows identification
	of the local geometry of sorption. Polarized X-ray fine structure
	spectroscopy further allows determination of the orientation and
	density of the complexes on the various Fe surface planes. However,
	this information is incomplete as any response of the surface to
	sorption is not revealed, and hydrogen bonding and water molecule
	arrangement at the surface can be changed due to the sorption process.
	To access these we use CTR experiments and compare the results with
	samples without sorbed anions. GIEXAFS results for both hematite
	(0&#xa0;0&#xa0;0&#xa0;1) and ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) planes show arsenate sorbed
	in two ways: bidentate binuclear and bidentate mononuclear. Most
	of the latter type of sorption geometry appears to be present on
	surface step edges on the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface, while there is little
	or no such attachment to the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface terraces. These
	results appear consistent with preliminary structural models obtained
	by CTR work for the clean and sorbed wet hematite surfaces, and further
	analysis is in progress. In the case of silicate, strong changes
	in the CTR are observed indicating considerable surface interactions.
	CTR measurements of the silicate on the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface of
	hematite suggest that a monodentate sorption geometry is more dominant
	than other possible sorption geometries. However GIEXAFS analysis
	done on analogous samples at the Si K-edge shows second shell contributions
	that are similar to amorphous silica, and are largely independent
	of sorption density. These results suggest that there are at least
	two kinds of silicate on the hematite surface: a chemically bound
	fraction present as a silicateâ€“Fe3+ octahedral complex, and an
	incoherent portion which is not detectable by the CTR measurements
	but appears to dominate the GIEXAFS results. The complexed silicate
	on the hematite ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface is linked by a single oxygen
	to surface Fe, i.e., a monodentate connection, with an interatomic
	Si-Fe distance close to those observed in the nontronite and acmite
	structures. This is the first evidence to our knowledge that identifies
	silicate as a well-defined sorption complex rather than only as an
	amorphous surface precipitate. More significantly, the monodentate
	complex is apparently favored over a more strongly bound bidentate
	complexation geometry, suggesting that polymerization at the interface
	may originate synchronously with sorption and be mitigated by the
	position of surface sites consistent with a polymerized network.
	These findings have important significance for the nature of passivation
	processes on Fe oxides and other important reactive natural surfaces.},
