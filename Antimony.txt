After correction, Sc, for contributions from soil dust, depositional fluxes of Sb and Pb peaked from . 1920-1960 A.D., with >95% of the anthropogenic inventories deposited post-1800 A.D. Over the past two centuries, trends in Sb and Pb deposition have been broadly similar, with fluctuations in the anthropogenic Sb/Pb ratio reflecting temporal variations in the relative input from emission sources such as the mining and smelting of Pb ores (in which Sb is commonly present, as at Leadhills/Wanlockhead in southern Scotland), combustion of coal (for which the Sb/Pb ratio is approximately an order of magnitude greater than in Pb ores) and exhaust emissions (Pb from leaded petrol) and abrasion products from the brake linings (Sb from heat-resistant Sb compounds) of automobiles. The influence of leaded petrol has been most noticeable in recent decades, firstly through the resultant minima in Sb/Pb and Pb/Pb ratios (the latter arising from the use of less radiogenic Australian Pb in alkylPb additives) and then, during its phasing out and the adoption of unleaded petrol, complete by 2000 A.D., the subsequent increase in both Sb/Pb and Pb/Pb ratios. The extent of the 20th century maximum anthropogenic enrichment of Sb and Pb, relative to the natural Sc-normalised levels of the Upper Continental Crust, was similar at [similar]50- to 100-fold. Prior to 1800 A.D., the influence of metallurgical activities on Sb and Pb concentrations in the peat cores during both the Mediaeval and Roman/pre-Roman periods was discernible, small Sb and Pb peaks during the latter appearing attributable, on the basis of Pb isotopic composition, to the mining/smelting of Pb ores indigenous to Britain.},

   abstract = {The subtropical to equatorial Atlantic Ocean provides a unique regime in which one can examine the biogeochemical cycles of antimony and arsenic. In particular, this region is strongly affected by inputs from the Amazon River and dust from North Africa at the surface, and horizontal transport at depth from high-latitude northern (e.g., North Atlantic Deep Water) and southern waters (e.g., Antarctic Bottom and Intermediate Waters). As a part of the 1996 Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission's Contaminant Baseline Survey, data for dissolved As(III+V), As(III), mono- and dimethyl arsenic, Sb(III+V), Sb(III), and monomethyl antimony were obtained at six vertical profile stations and 44 sites along the 11,000&#xa0;km transect from Montevideo, Uruguay, to Bridgetown, Barbados. The arsenic results were similar to those in other oceans, with moderate surface depletion, deep-water enrichment, a predominance of arsenate (&gt;85% As(V)), and methylated arsenic species and As(III) in surface waters that are likely a result of phytoplankton conversions to mitigate arsenate “stress” (toxicity). Perhaps the most significant discovery in the arsenic results was the extremely low concentrations in the Amazon Plume (as low as 9.8&#xa0;nmol/l) that appear to extend for considerable distances offshore in the equatorial region. The very low concentration of inorganic arsenic in the Amazon River (2.8&#xa0;nmol/l; about half those in most rivers) is probably the result of intense iron oxyhydroxide scavenging. Dissolved antimony was also primarily in the pentavalent state (&gt;95% antimonate), but Sb(III) and monomethyl antimony were only detected in surface waters and displayed no correlations with biotic tracers such as nutrients and chlorophyll a. Unlike As(III+V)'s nutrient-type vertical profiles, Sb(III+V) displayed surface maxima and decreased into the deep waters, exhibiting the behavior of a scavenged element with a strong atmospheric input. While surface water Sb had a slight correlation with dissolved Al, it is likely that atmospheric Sb is delivered with combustion by-products and not from mineral aerosols. In the Amazon Plume, antimony concentrations dropped substantially, and an Amazon River sample had a concentration (0.25&#xa0;nmol/l) that was less than one-fourth those found in other major rivers. Using these river data, and estimates of atmospheric fluxes based on shipboard measurements and collections from Barbados, the atmospheric deposition of antimony to the equatorial Atlantic (2°S–8°N) is twice the Amazon flux, while the atmospheric deposition of arsenic is only 10% of the river's flux.},

   abstract = {Roasting of As and Sb-assocd. gold ore at the Giant mine, Yellowknife, Canada, resulted in complex solid-gas phase reactions between As, Sb, and roaster-derived Fe oxides. Sb, As, and their resp. hosting in two roaster waste streams and mine-impacted sediment were characterized using EPMA, μXRD, μXRF, bulk and μXANES. The roaster oxides in mine waste and sediment host As and Sb in multiple oxidn. states. In the cyanided roaster dust (ESP residue - composed of fine-grained particles mobilized during roasting, and sublimated phases), 3+ is the dominant As and Sb oxidn. state in the bulk sample and in the roaster-generated iron oxides that host these elements. Conversely, 5+ is the dominant As and Sb oxidn. state in the bulk calcine (oxidized and cyanided material collected from the roaster bed), and in the roaster Fe oxide grains therein. These results have important implications for predicting the fate of As and Sb in the environment, and for distinguishing between anthropogenically-influenced speciation and speciation resulting from post-depositional transformations. As and Sb-bearing roaster iron oxides and other As and Sb-bearing phases in mine-impacted sediment collected from the surficial zone (0 to -1 cm) and relatively reducing zone (-16 cm) are also described. As and Sb assocd. with roaster oxides in the relatively reducing sediment have undergone post-depositional transformation and 10-20% of As and Sb are attenuated via pptn. as sulfide or sorption to sulfide surfaces. The attenuation of Sb is more efficient than As, and Sb is only mobile at the micron scale. In the relatively reducing sediment, where most of the As is reduced to As3+, Sb5+ bound to oxygen phase persists and represents 58% of the total Sb. [on SciFinder(R)]},

No Sb biomagnifications were observed. The bioavailability of Sb was found to be lower than those of As and Hg. A preliminary conclusion is that antagonistic effects exist between Sb and Hg accumulation in biological samples from aquatic environments. Our study is the first to report such antagonistic effects between Sb and Hg. If this deduction proves to be correct, it should be taken into consideration in assessing human health risks, especially when Sb and Hg concentrations in the aquatic environments are high.},

   abstract = {A chemico-toxicological similarity between arsenic and antimony exists and their toxicology is often seen. Indeed, both elements possess several common properties, e.g. they are clastogenic but not mutagenic in the trivalent state and they have a carcinogenic potential: trivalent arsenicals are known to be human carcinogens and antimony(III) oxide (by inhalation) has been shown to cause lung cancer in female rats. For years, arsenic has been known to be environmentally toxic. Elevated human exposure to this element, mostly caused by the intake of contaminated tap water, is associated with increased incidences of cancer at various sites. It is still not clear how arsenic compounds exert their genotoxic effect. It may be connected with an inhibition of DNA repair or the induction of oxidative stress. Little work has been done on the toxicology of antimony as it is less widely present in the environment. There is evidence that in mammals antimony, unlike arsenic, is not detoxified via methylation but it still remains unclear what mechanism is responsible for antimony's genotoxicity. In general, there is little information known about this element to accurately determine its impact on human health. Thus, the aim of this paper is to review current knowledge for future risk assessment and further scientific work.},

In 1965 a private company began to investigate the deposit and by 1968 had installed a 100-tpd rotary furnace. Since, the ore supply has been inadequate and the furnace plant used to process ore hauled from other deposits. Mercury production was terminated in 1975, owing to low prices, and in 1976 the furnace plant was used to process antimony ore (Yıldız and Bailey, 1978 ). Areas near the mine are currently being used for agricultural purposes. Soils are directly influenced by contaminants, leaching from the mine wastes, which are transported by surface waters in the rainy season.

Trace metals in the water were fractionated in situ according to size (nominal molecular mass) and charge properties. During the experimental period an episode with higher runoff occurred resulting in increased levels of metals in the stream. Pb and Cu were mainly found as high molecular mass species, while Zn and Sb were mostly present as low molecular mass species. Pb, Cu and Sb accumulated on gills, in addition to Al origination from natural sources in the catchment. Pb, Cu and Sb were also detected at elevated concentration in the liver. Blood glucose and plasma Na and Cl levels were significantly altered during the exposure period, and are attributed to elevated concentrations of Pb, Cu and Al. A significant suppression of ALA-D was detected after 11 days. Significant differences were detected in Cd/Zn-MT and oxidative stress (tGSH/GSSG) responses at Day 4. For Pb the results show a clear link between the HMM (high molecular mass) positively charged Pb species, followed by accumulation on gills and liver and a suppression in ALA-D.

Samples of mine wastes, various types of waters, stream sediments, soils, and leachates of the mine wastes, stream sediments and selected soils were analyzed for As and Sb to evaluate their geochemical dispersion from the mines. Mine wastes collected at the mine sites contained up to 5166&#xa0;mg/kg As and 9861&#xa0;mg/kg Sb. Arsenic in mine wastes was associated mostly with Fe oxides, whereas Sb was present frequently in the form of individual Sb, Sb(Fe) and Fe(Sb) oxides. Waters of different types such as groundwater, surface waters and mine waters, all contained elevated concentrations of As and Sb, reaching up to 2150&#xa0;μg/L As and 9300&#xa0;μg/L Sb, and had circum-neutral pH values because of the buffering capacity of abundant Ca- and Mg-carbonates. The concentrations of Sb in several household wells are a cause for concern, exceeding the Sb drinking water limit of 5&#xa0;μg/L by as much as 25&#xa0;times. Some attenuation of the As and Sb concentrations in mine and impoundment waters was expected because of the deposition of metalloids onto hydrous ferric oxides built up below adit entrances and impoundment discharges. These HFOs contained&#xa0;&gt;20&#xa0;wt.% As and 1.5&#xa0;wt.% Sb. Stream sediments and soils have also been contaminated by As and Sb with the peak concentrations generally found near open adits and mine wastes. In addition to the discharged waters from open adits, the significant source of As and Sb contamination are waste-rock dumps and tailings impoundments. Leachates from mine wastes contained as much as 8400&#xa0;μg/L As and 4060&#xa0;μg/L Sb, suggesting that the mine wastes would have a great potential to contaminate the downstream environment. Moreover, the results of water leaching tests showed that Sb was released from the solids more efficiently than As under oxidizing conditions. This might partly explain the predominance of Sb over As in most water samples.},

The remarkable enrichment of potentially toxic antimony (Sb) in inhalable airborne particulate matter has become of great environmental concern among recent air pollution issues. The present study clarifies the predominant sources of Sb by focusing on the similarities in elemental composition, particle size distributions, and microscopic images found in ambient airborne particles and several potential sources. We identify automotive brake abrasion dust and fly ash emitted from waste incineration as dominant sources of atmospheric Sb in Japan. These results will contribute towards an in-depth understanding of the cycles and fates of Sb in the environment. Abstract. By focusing on the similarities in elemental composition, particle size distributions of elemental concentrations, and microscopic images between ambient airborne particulate matter (APM) and several potential sources, we discuss the predominant sources of antimony (Sb) in APM in Japan. The distribution of Sb concentration in size-classified ambient APM showed a characteristic bimodal profile in which peaks were found in coarse (3.6–5.2 μm) and fine (0.5–0.7 μm) fractions. Elemental ratios, particle sizes, and microscopic images observed in the coarse APM fractions were found to be in good agreement with those of brake abrasion dust. However, in the fine APM fractions, fly ash originating from waste incineration was identified as the most probable source of Sb. Chemical mass balance analysis was performed to determine the effects of the emission sources of Sb, and it was revealed that brake abrasion dust and waste fly ash were the dominant sources of Sb in the coarser and the finer fractions of APM, respectively. The present study provides important clues to understanding the cycles and fates of Sb in the environment.},

   abstract = {Various metals and metalloids can be converted by a variety of microorganisms to their volatile methyl derivatives. These bioconversions are important from an environmental perspective because they take place over long time periods and the products have quite different properties (e.g., transportation, toxicological) as compared to the inorganic species from which they are derived. Whereas the biomethylation of arsenic is well established, that of the closely related element antimony is not, and there are no reports of antimony methylation by monoseptic microbial cultures. We report here, for the first time, the formation of trimethylantimony [(CH3)3Sb] by a characterized microorganism, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, grown aerobically in the presence of inorganic antimony. Volatile antimony evolved into the headspace above the fungal cultures was quantified by remote trapping and analysis by inductively coupled plasma?mass spectrometry (ICP?MS). The existence of biogenic trimethylantimony was established, following exclusion of oxygen from cultures after growth, by remote trapping of volatile compounds and analysis by gas chromatography with compound-specific (mass spectrometry) or element-specific (atomic absorption) detec tion. No other volatile product containing antimony was detected in culture headspace gases.},

In this study, the distribution of antimony in the river water environment including water, sediment, aquatic plants and fishes was surveyed in the Yodo River basin. The characteristics of antimony distribution between river water and sediment were determined by the batch sorption experiments, focusing on the difference in oxidation state. This study suggests that biota in the Yodo River basin have antimony at concentrated levels. Some of the sewage treatment plants seemed to influence the concentration of antimony in river water. It was shown that the pentavalent antimony is dominant in river water and especially paramount downstream of the sewage treatment plants, though the trivalent antimony is dominant in industrial use. According to the sorption experiments of antimony on river sediment, the trivalent antimony is sorbed faster and more in partition than the pentavalent antimony.[on SciFinder (R)]},

Natural background concentrations of Sb and Sc established during the period between 1300 years BP and 10,590 years BP averaged 0.08 ± 0.03 pg/g (N = 18) and 0.44 ± 0.20 pg/g (N = 17), respectively. Scandium, a conservative reference element, was used as a surrogate for mineral dust inputs. The Sb/Sc ratio of 0.13 ± 0.07 in these ancient ice samples is comparable to the corresponding ratio of 0.09 ± 0.03 in peat samples from Switzerland from circa 6000 to 9000 years BP, indicating that this natural background ratio might have a much broader validity. The natural background flux of Sb (0.7 ± 0.5 ng/m2/a) in the Arctic was approximately 500 times lower than that established in central Europe using peat cores. For comparison with background values, modern Sb fluxes calculated using 45 samples from a 5-m snow pit dug on Devon Island in 2004, reflecting 10 years of snow accumulation, yielded an average deposition rate of 340 ± 270 ng/m2/a (range: 20&#8211;1240 ng/m2/a) with pronounced accumulation of Sb during winter periods when air masses reaching the Arctic predominantly come from Eurasia. These data reveal that approximately 99.8% of the Sb deposited in the Arctic today originates from anthropogenic activities. Modern Sb enrichment factors averaged 25 (range: 8&#8211;121). The ice core provides evidence of Sb contamination dating from Phoenician/Greek, Roman, and medieval lead mining and smelting in Europe. Moreover, the ice core data indicate that anthropogenic sources of Sb have continuously dominated the atmospheric inputs to the Arctic for at least 700 years.},

   abstract = {Adopting recently developed clean laboratory techniques, antimony (Sb) and scandium (Sc) deposition were measured in a 63.72 m-long ice core (1842-1996) and a 5 m deep snow pit (1994-2004) collected on Devon Island, Canadian High Arctic. Antimony concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 108 pg g with a median of 0.98 pg g ( = 510). Scandium, used as a conservative reference element, revealed that dust inputs were effectively constant during the last 160 years. The atmospheric Sb signal preserved in the ice core reflects contamination from industrialisation, the economic boom which followed WWII, as well as the comparatively recent introduction of flue gas filter technologies and emission reduction efforts. Natural contributions to the total Sb inventory are negligible, meaning that anthropogenic emissions have dominated atmospheric Sb deposition throughout the entire period. The seasonal resolution of the snow pit showed that aerosols deposited during the Arctic winter, when air masses are derived mainly from Eurasia, show the greatest Sb concentrations. Deposition during summer, when air masses come mainly from North America, is still enriched in Sb, but less so. Snow and ice provide unambiguous evidence that enrichments of Sb in Arctic air have increased 50% during the past three decades, with two-thirds being deposited during winter. Most Sb is produced in Asia, primarily from Sb sulfides such as stibnite (SbS), but also as a by-product of lead and copper smelting. In addition there is a growing worldwide use of Sb in automobile brake pads, plastics and flame retardants. In contrast to Pb which has gone into decline during the same interval because of the gradual elimination of gasoline lead additives, the enrichments of Sb have been increasing and today clearly exceed those of Pb. Given that the toxicity of Sb is comparable to that of Pb, Sb has now replaced Pb in the rank of potentially toxic trace metals in the Arctic atmosphere.},

   abstract = {Antimony is an element of growing interest for a variety of industrial applications, even though Sb compounds are classified as priority pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. Iron (Fe) hydroxides appear to be important sorbents for Sb in soils and sediments, but mineral surfaces can also catalyze oxidation processes and may thus mobilize Sb. The aim of this study was to investigate whether goethite immobilizes Sb by sorption or whether Sb(III) adsorbed on goethite is oxidized and then released. The sorption of both Sb(III) and Sb(V) on goethite was studied in 0.01 and 0.1 M KClO4 M solutions as a function of pH and Sb concentration. To monitor oxidation processes Sb species were measured in solution and in the solid phase. The results show that both Sb(III) and Sb(V) form inner-sphere surface complexes at the goethite surface. Antimony(III) strongly adsorbs on goethite over a wide pH range (3?12), whereas maximum Sb(V) adsorption is found below pH 7. At higher ionic strength, the desorption of Sb(V) is shifted to lower pH values, most likely due to the formation of ion pairs KSb(OH)6°. The sorption data of Sb(V) can be fitted by the modified triple-layer surface complexation model. Within 7 days, Sb(III) adsorbed on goethite is partly oxidized at pH 3, 5.9 and 9.7. The weak pH-dependence of the rate coefficients suggests that adsorbed Sb(III) is oxidized by O2 and that the coordination of Sb(III) to the surface increases the electron density of the Sb atom, which enhances the oxidation process. At pH values below pH 7, the oxidation of Sb(III) did not mobilize Sb within 35 days, while 30% of adsorbed Sb(III) was released into the solution at pH 9.9 within the same time. The adsorption of Sb(III) on Fe hydroxides over a wide pH range may be a major pathway for the oxidation and release of Sb(V).},

The samples were characterized by x-ray fluorescence anal. for their total concn. of metalloids, metals and main constituents. It was found that both Sb and As show little mobilization with de-ionized water as well as artificial acidic rain in single step batch procedures (≤0.13% of the total content). Although the percentage leached is very low, the concns. in the resulting solns. are of ecotoxicol. relevance. BCR procedure indicate a very strong binding of Sb and of As in the samples. Less than 20% of the total content can be leached in sum in all leaching steps, of it most under strongly oxidizing conditions. This scheme seems not suitable for a detailed study of possible mobilization processes under environmental conditions for the metalloids under study. The 4-step extn. procedure by Wenzel et al. gives a more detailed pattern of the binding of Sb and As. This procedure is a suitable scheme for evaluating the possible mobilization processes from the samples contaminated by ore processing waste, esp. by change through other ions or under reducing conditions.

Here we report for the first time the chem. speciation of Sb in soil and porewater of flooded paddy soil, impacted by active Sb mining, and its effect on uptake and speciation in rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv Jiahua). Results are compared with behavior and uptake of As. Pot expts. were conducted under controlled conditions in a climate chamber over a period of 50 days. In pots without rice plants, flooding increased both the concn. of dissolved Sb (up to ca 2000 μg L-1) and As (up to ca 1500 μg L-1). When rice was present, Fe plaque developing on rice roots acted as a scavenger for both As and Sb, whereby the concn. of As, but not Sb, in porewater decreased substantially. Dissolved Sb in porewater, which occurred mainly as Sb(V), correlated with Ca, indicating a soly. governed by Ca antimonate. No significant differences in bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor between Sb and As were obsd. Greater relative concn. of Sb(V) was found in rice shoots compared to rice root and porewater, indicating either a preferred uptake of Sb(V) or possibly an oxidn. of Sb(III) to Sb(V) in shoots. Adding soil amendments (olivine, hematite) to the paddy soil had no effect on Sb and As concns. in porewater. [on SciFinder(R)]},

A silt-loam soil (pH 7.0, background 0.005 mmol Sb kg-1) was amended with Sb2O3 at various concns. More than 70% of Sb in soil soln. was present as Sb(V) (antimonate) within 2 days. The soil soln. Sb concns. gradually increased between 2 and 35 days after Sb2O3 amendment but were always below that of soils amended with the more sol. SbCl3 at the lower Sb concns. The soil soln. Sb concns. in freshly amended SbCl3 soils (7 days equilibration) were equiv. to those in Sb2O3-amended soils equilibrated for 5 years at equiv. total soil Sb. Our data indicate that the Sb soly. in this soil was controlled by a combination of sorption on the soil surface, Sb pptn. at the higher doses, and slow dissoln. of Sb2O3, the latter being modeled with a half-life ranging between 50 and 250 days. Toxicity of Sb to plant growth (root elongation of barley, shoot biomass of lettuce) or to nitrification was found in soil equilibrated with Sb2O3 (up to 82 mmol Sb kg-1) for 31 wk with 10% inhibition values at soil soln. Sb concns. of 110 μM Sb or above. These concns. are equiv. to 4.2 mmol Sb per kg soil (510 mg Sb kg-1) at complete dissoln. of Sb2O3 in this soil. No toxicity to plant growth or nitrification was evident in toxicity tests starting one week after soil amendment with Sb2O3, whereas clear toxicity was found in a similar test using SbCl3. However, these effects were confounded by a decrease in pH and an increase in salinity. It is concluded that the Sb(V) toxicity thresholds are over 100-fold larger than background concns. in soil and that care must be taken to interpret toxicity data of sol. Sb(III) forms due to confounding factors. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The concns. of these elements were measured using instrumental neutron activation anal. (INAA). INAA was preferred to other modern anal. techniques because of its relatively higher selectivity, sensitivity and high precision. Beside its multielemental nature, INAA is very fast and thus presents a very good anal. tool for the detn. of elemental concns. in various samples including water and sediment. The samples were irradiated using a 30 kW tank-in-pool Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) operating at a thermal neutron flux of 5 × 1011 n s-1 cm-2. The samples were irradiated and counted without any chem. treatment. Elevated levels of As and Sb were found in both water and sediment. Generally, As and Sb concns. in the water samples ranged from 0.90-8.25 ppm and 0.09-0.75 ppm resp. These values far exceed the WHO recommended values for As and Sb in water, 0.01 ppm and 0.005 ppm resp. The levels of As in sediment ranged from 942-10,200 ppm, and that of Sb was 8.5-90.4 ppm. Arsenic concns. in both water and sediment were generally higher than Sb concns. This is, however, not surprising as arsenopyrites (FeAsS2) are among the major pathfinder minerals assocd. with gold mined from Ghana.

Nitric acid (1 M) extractable Sb from the shooting range (8300 μg kg-1) and the apple orchard (69 μg kg-1) had considerably higher surface Sb levels than the control site (<1.5 μg kg-1), and Sb was confined to the top ∼30 cm soil layer. Sb(V) was the principal species in the shooting range and the apple orchard surface soils. Size exclusion chromatog.-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS) anal. of humic acids isolated from the two contaminated soils demonstrated that Sb has complexed to humic acid molar mass fractions. Also, humic acids have the ability to arrest the mobility of Sb through soils and would be beneficial in converting Sb(III) to a less toxic species, Sb(V), in contaminated areas. The soil surface and depth distribution Sb(V) and Sb(III) species in a contaminated apple orchard and a shooting range, and the effect soil humic acids on inorg. antimony species is reported.

Within the Macleay floodplain of north-eastern NSW it was found that approximately 90% of the floodplain is enriched in As and Sb, and 6–8% of the floodplain contains As and Sb levels greater than current Australian soil environmental investigation levels. Variation in surface and depth distributions indicated flood deposition of As and Sb across major environmental floodplain environments, with highest accumulation in modern swamp depositional environments. The soil enrichment was reflected by pasture uptake (up to 6.4 and 2.2 mg kg−1 for As and Sb, respectively) and elevated surface water concentrations (up to 10 and 21 times drinking guideline values and 2.9 and 6.9 times freshwater trigger values for protection of 95% of species for As and Sb, respectively) of these metalloids. Significant relationships between pasture and total soil levels imply higher relative availability than is typical at grossly contaminated sites. Implications for metalloid mobility and availability in acid sulfate soil environments in the floodplain are discussed.},

In one treatment Sb was added to the exptl. soils as KSb(OH)6 ("SbV-treatment") and in the other as Sb2O3 ("SbIII-treatment"). Sol. soil Sb concns. were linearly related to the applied Sb rates, ranging from 0.02 (controls) to 175 mg L-1 soil soln. Accumulation of Sb tended to be slightly higher in the SbV treatment in sunflower, while no difference in Sb uptake between the two Sb treatments was found in maize. The half maximal effective concn. (EC50) values derived from the dose-response curves were higher for the SbV than for the SbIII treatment when they were related to sol. soil Sb concns., but differences became insignificant when they were related to shoot Sb concns. Maize was substantially more sensitive to Sb toxicity than sunflower, indicating physiol. differences in Sb tolerance between the two plant species. Our results show that on soils with high Sb contamination, as often found in shooting ranges, plants may suffer from Sb toxicity. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Sb in soil over a concn. range covering five or more orders of magnitude. However, very little is known about the mechanisms of Sb uptake by plants. Also the deposition of resuspended soil particles on the surfaces of aerial plant surfaces can result in high plant Sb concn. in the vicinity of Sb-contaminated sites. Although soil pollution by Sb may be rarely so severe as to cause toxicity problems to humans or animals consuming plants or food derived from plants grown on Sb-contaminated sites, such risks may arise under worst-case conditions.

   abstract = {Soil samples were collected from an antimony smelting site in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, at four locations characterized by different land usage, including two cultivated sites: one formerly cultivated and one uncultivated. Surface soils from all four sites were heavily polluted by toxic metals including antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As), and their concns. were 410-3330 mg/kg-1, 410-3690 mg/kg-1, and 200-460 mg/kg-1, resp. In the uncultivated area, metal levels were 1.4-6.2 times higher as compared to the formerly and currently cultivated agricultural land. Lower levels at the cultivated sites may have resulted from an accumulated uptake of airborne particles by vegetation and lower contents in the surface soil. However, the elevated mercury (Hg) content may reflect both natural and anthropogenic origins in this smelting site. Soil-derived humic acid (HA) from the smelting site reacted directly with Sb (III) aq. solns. with concns. of 12, 71, and 143 mg/g-1. The max. Sb (III) binding to the soil-derived HA was 253 μmol/g-1 (added concn. of 71 mg/g-1) and showed more binding (up to 50%) at lower Sb content. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {Trace metal contamination from bullet fragments in shooting ranges is a major environmental concern. In particular, trace metals such as lead, antimony, and copper are toxic and have the potential to enter groundwater supplies and to be absorbed by plants. Soil humic acids can play a crit. role in mobilizing some of these released metals through complexation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antimony complexed to soil-derived humic molar mass fractions extd. from various depths in a shooting range soil and to examine the distribution of antimony in various fractions of shooting range soils using sequential chem. extn. approach. The surface soil and soil core samples from a local shooting range were collected. Soil-derived humic acids were extd. from different depths of the top soil layer and characterized by various spectroscopic methods. Results of sequential chem. extn. demonstrated that Sb was found in shooting range in the upper 30 cm depth of the soil core. Highly elevated Sb is present in the exchangeable and ammonium acetate extd. fractions. Antimony is also present in the residual fraction in both surface and core soil samples, but is most likely present in a lithic phase which may not be readily bio-available. Leached antimony complexed to soil humic acid molar mass fractions was detd. by size exclusion chromatog. coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS). The results demonstrate that Sb is 'tightly' bound to humic acid mass molar mass fractions and confined in the top 10 cm of soil-derived humic acids. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Joint effects of both Sb and As were different from that of Sb or As alone. The inhibition rate of culturable soil microbial populations under Sb and As pollution followed the order: bacterial > fungi > actinomycetes. There existed antagonistic inhibiting effect on urease and acid phosphatase and synergistic inhibiting effect on protease under the combined pollution of Sb (III) and As (III). Only urease appeared to be the most sensitive indicator under Sb (V) and As (V) pollution, and there existed antagonistic inhibiting effect on acid phosphatase and synergistic inhibiting effect on urease and protease under Sb (V) and As (V) combined pollution at most time. In this study, we also confirmed that the trivalent states of Sb and As were more toxic to all the microbes tested and more inhibitory on microbial enzyme activities then their pentavalent counterparts. The results also suggest that not only the application rate of the two metalloids but also the chem. form of metalloids should be considered while assessing the effect of metalloid on culturable microbial populations and enzyme activities. Urease and acid phosphatase can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the intensity of Sb (III) and As (III) stress. [on SciFinder(R)]},

There were increasingly inhibitive effects of ionic strength of NaCl on the biosorption capacities. The high desorption efficiency was achieved using 4 mol/L HCl. The regeneration studies show that the biomass could be used for a min. of five repetitive cycles. The ATR-IR spectra anal. suggested the involvement of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups in Sb(III) biosorption through surface complexation. Furthermore, the results of speciation anal. found the concurrence of oxidn. of Sb(III) with the biosorption process, which is beneficial to alleviate the ecol. toxicity of Sb(III).

The translocation coeffs. of Sb from plant roots to above-ground biomass also varies greatly with plant species. Chem. forms of Sb exist mainly at +3 and +5 in aquatic environment and are affected by the redox conditions. Bioaccumulation of Sb in aquatic environment focuses on the algae. The mechanisms involved in adsorption and partition of Sb inside cell are unclear. So far little information was available on environmental behavior of Sb and its toxicity to higher plants and microbes. The transport and transformation of Sb in pedosphere, hydrosphere and atm. and among them, and the mol. mechanisms of toxicity of Sb to higher plants and microorganisms need further study.
