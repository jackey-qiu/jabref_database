	Introduction
	
	From an environmental standpoint, corundum (α-Al2O3) and hematite
	(α-Fe2O3) are of particular interest because of the use of the former
	as a model compound for Al-(oxyhydr)oxides present in the environment
	and the relative abundance of the latter in nature and its importance
	as a sorbent of aqueous
	
	cations, such as Hg(II), and oxoanions, such as HAsO4.
	
	
	our focus is on explaining these differences in reactivity through
	a detailed computational investigation of the structural changes
	due to hydration and hydroxylation of α-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 surfaces.
	
	
	Both α-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 can form two energetically stable surfaces,
	i.e., the (0001) or c-cut and the (1¯102) or r-cut surface,which
	exhibit significantly different structural relaxations in the presence
	of water.As a result, the c-cut surface of α-Fe2O3 is much more reactive
	to the adsorption and dissociation of water compared with the r-cut
	surface of α-Fe2O3 and either of the α-Al2O3 surfaces
	
	
	hydrated c-cut surface of α-Fe2O3 consists of two distinct domains,
	one in which surface hydroxyl groups are singly coordinated by iron(III)
	ions and one in which the surface hydroxyls are singly, doubly, and
	triply coordinated by iron(III) ions.3 In comparison, the hydrated
	c-cut surface of α-Al2O3 has only surface hydroxyl groups doubly
	coordinated by aluminum ions.
	
	
	In the case of the hydrated r-cut surfaces of both hematite and corundum,
	there are equal proportions of singly, doubly, and triply coordinated
	hydroxyl groups, yet the hydrated hematite r-cut surface is more
	reactive than the corresponding hydrated surface of corundum.
	
	There are also differences in the mode of binding of cations on the
	two surfaces. For example, aqueous U(VI) has been found to form dominantly
	
	inner-sphere bidentate complexes on the hydrated α-Fe2O3 r-cut surface
	and dominantly monodentate complexes on the hydrated α-Al2O3 r-cut
	surface.
	
	In addition, aqueous Pb(II) ions form dominantly inner-sphere complexes
	on the hydrated α-Fe2O3 c-cut, α-Fe2O3 r-cut, and α-Al2O3 r-cut surfaces,
	but
	
	they form dominantly outer-sphere complexes on the hydrated α-Al2O3
	c-cut surface.
	
	
	These differences in metal-ion surface complexation suggest different
	chemical reactivities of these different hydrated metal-oxide surfaces,
	which are
	
	likely due to differences in (1) metal ions (Al3+ vs Fe3+), (2) surface
	relaxation in the presence of water (i.e., hydroxylation effects),
	(3) the acid/base properties of surface sites, and (4) interaction
	of physisorbed water with the surfaces.
	
	
	Water molecules will tend to orient in such a way as to shield the
	charged hydroxyl groups, thereby decreasing the polarizability of
	the water and reducing the dielectric constant of water near the
	surface. The interfacial dielectric constant is difficult to measure
	experimentally, and values ranging from 6 to 53 (compared to 78 in
	bulk water) have been suggested for water in contact with both α-Al2O3
	and α-Fe2O3.9
	
	
	Whether an ion interacts with the surface via inner-sphere or outersphere
	complexation (or both simultaneously11) depends on a complicated
	interaction between these surface hydroxyl groups and the corresponding
	induced electric field from the charged species, all of which ultimately
	depend on the geometric and electronic structures of the given surface.
	
	
	Surface free energy
	
	At high temperatures, the hydrogen atoms are not stable on the surface,
	and the M1 clean stoichiometric surface (M1 bulk), which has no hydroxyl
	groups, is the most energetically favorable. At room temperature
	and below over most of the pressure range (−12 to ∼ 1 log p/p0) the
	M1-OH-OH surface is the most
	
	stable in which the first two layers of oxygen atoms are hydroxylated.
	However, the M2-OH2-OH surface termination with missing Al atoms
	becomes stable at room temperature at log p/p0 >∼ 1.
	
	
	Difference in surface rexlaxation of a-Al2O3 and a-Fe2O3
	
	The atoms in the top surface layers of α-Al2O3 experience more relaxation
	with respect to the bulk positions than surface atoms in α-Fe2O3
	under the same environmental conditions. These differences in layer
	relaxation extend as much as nine to ten layers into the bulk region
	(Tables II and III). The protonation states of the singly, doubly,
	and triply coordinated oxygen atoms directly affect both the type
	and the extent of relaxation.
	
	
	It is possible that, in the experimental work, the surface is not
	entirely homogeneous, and the CTR measurements include multiple hydroxylation
	configurations on the surface.
	
	the effect of physisorbed water on the layer relaxation of the α-Al2O3
	r-cut surfaces was also examined, but it did not significantly change
	the results or the geometric structure of the M2-OH-OH-OH surface,
	which is in closest agreement with the CTR diffraction results.
	
	
	
	Reactivity
	
	Comparison of the DOS of α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 6) with the DOS of α-Al2O3
	shows a much higher concentration of electron-acceptor sites from
	the d states of the Fe atoms within the band gap compared with the
	p states of the Al atoms.
	
	it is clear that the number of empty Fe states at the α-Fe2O3 r-cut
	surface is very high and close to the Fermi level and will contribute
	to a much stronger degree of reactivity in terms of its Lewis acid
	sites compared to the α-Al2O3 r-cut surface.
	
	
	Bond length
	
	typicalOHinternal distance is on the order of 1 A°
	
	typical hydrogenbonding distances are on the order of 2.5–3 °A
	
	
	the addition of two and three layers of water does not significantly
	change the layer relaxation of the α-Al2O3 surface structure},

	Î¼moles/m2), and [Pb]eq (0.2 Î¼M â€“ 1.2 mM) in 0.1 M NaNO3 electrolyte

	and adsorbed as mononuclear bidentate complexes to edges of FeO6
	octahedra on both goethite and hematite under all conditions. Hydrolysis
	of Pb(II) appears to be a primary source of proton release associated

	to relate the relative stabilities of iron-oxide surface functional
	groups and Pb(II) adsorption complexes to their structures and compositions.
	This combined approach suggests that Pb(II) adsorption occurs primarily
	at unprotonated [FeFeFeî˜‰O12] sites and at [Feî—¸OH2+12] sites.
	Several adsorption reactions are proposed. Comparison to EXAFS results
	from Pb(II) adsorption on aluminum oxides suggests that the edge
	lengths of surface AlO6 or FeO6 octahedra partially determine the
	reactivities and densities of available surface sites. The results

  abstract = {Lead contamination at shooting range soils is of great environmental
	concern. This study focused on weathering of lead bullets and its
	effect on the environment at five outdoor shooting ranges in Florida,
	USA. Soil, plant, and water samples were collected from the ranges
	and analyzed for total Pb and/or toxicity characteristic leaching
	procedure (TCLP) Pb. Selected bullet and berm soil samples were mineralogically
	analyzed with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.
	Hydrocerussite [Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2] was found in both the weathered crusts
	and berm soils in the shooting ranges with alkaline soil pH. For
	those shooting ranges with acidic soil pH, hydrocerussite, cerussite
	(PbCO3), and small amount of massicot (PbO) were predominantly present
	in the weathered crusts, but no lead carbonate mineral was found
	in the soils. However, hydroxypyromorphite [(Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2] was
	formed in a P-rich acidic soil, indicating that hydroxypyromorphite
	can be a stable mineral in P-rich shooting range soil. Total Pb and
	TCLP Pb in the soils from all five shooting ranges were significantly
	elevated with the highest total Pb concentration of 1.27 to 4.84%
	(w/w) in berm soils. Lead concentrations in most sampled soils exceeded
	the USEPA's critical level of 400 mg Pb kg-1 soil. Lead was not detected
	in subsurface soils in most ranges except for one, where elevated
	Pb up to 522 mg kg-1 was observed in the subsurface, possibly due
	to enhanced solubilization of organic Pb complexes at alkaline soil
	pH. Elevated total Pb concentrations in bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon
	(L.) Pers.] (up to 806 mg kg-1 in the aboveground parts) and in surface
	water (up to 289 Î¼g L-1) were observed in some ranges. Ranges with
	high P content or high cation exchange capacity showed lower Pb mobility.
	Our research clearly demonstrates the importance of properly managing
	shooting ranges to minimize adverse effects of Pb on the environment.},

	Introduction
	
	The interface between a mineral and aqueous solution is a chemical
	and structural transition region where many important geochemical
	reactions occur, such as adsorption and desorption, precipitation
	and dissolution, and heterogeneous oxidation and reduction
	
	Water in the mineral–aqueous solution interfacial region often displays
	molecular-level ordering that decays away from the mineral surface
	
	
	Surfaces of iron oxides such as hematite (a-Fe2O3) are of particular
	importance because of such minerals ability to adsorb trace elements,
	heavy metal, and radionuclides and to serve as terminal electron
	acceptors for dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (Brown et al.,
	1999).
	
	
	Interfacial structure 
	
	The observation of only minor relaxations of the hematite structure
	near the surface demonstrates that the stability of the bulk structure
	is affected little by
	
	the creation of a surface. This stability is likely the result of
	the general stability of Fe(III) octahedra.
	
	
	Thus, the surfaces of iron and aluminum oxide phases under conditions
	where chemical species (e.g., water) are available to maintain a
	stable coordination (i.e., octahedral) of Fe and Al will likely always
	display only minor changes in the metal–oxygen bond lengths and arrangements
	of surface functional groups predicted from the bulk structure.
	
	
	water ordering ans structure
	
	However, ordering of interfacial water decays faster from the surface
	on hematite, with only the first adsorbed water site having a similar
	vibrational amplitude as seen on corundum.
	
	Corundum displays O–O distance of 2.52–2.86A ˚ , with an average distance
	of 2.72A ˚ (Ishizawa et al.,1980), whereas hematite displays O–O
	distances of 2.66–3.03A ˚ , with an average distance of 2.88A ˚ (Finger
	and Hazen,1980). Recent X-ray scattering studies of liquid water
	structure display a maximum in the O–O pair correlation function
	at 2.73A ˚ (Hura et al., 2000; Sorenson et al., 2000), similar to
	the average O–O spacing in corundum. This suggests that the oxygen
	lattice, and thus the surface functional group arrangement, of corundum
	may better match the natural structuring of water than that of hematite,
	
	and thus may induce stronger ordering of the interfacial water.
	
	
	Taken together, this suggests that water exchange rates of Fe(III)
	species are uniformly faster than for comparable Al(III) species,
	and it is reasonable to
	
	assume that singly coordinated oxygen functional groups on hematite
	will have faster exchange rates than on corundum. It is thus possible
	that the weaker ordering of water seen near the hematite surface
	may be partly due to this suspected difference in exchange dynamics.
	
	
	comparative surface chemistry of hematite and corundum
	
	Hematite and corundum (012) surfaces are also expected to display
	generally similar reactivity towards adsorbates. Recent studies of
	arsenate adsorption on these surfaces highlight these similarities.
	
	Arsenate reacts with hematite and corundum (012) surfaces to form
	both bridging-bidentate inner-sphere surfaces complexes as well as
	non-bonded outer-sphere complexes (Catalano et al., 2006c). The ratio
	of inner-sphere to outer-sphere complexes was higher on hematite,
	indicating subtle differences in reactivity, but the general uptake
	behavior and adsorption mechanisms were the same on both surfaces.},

	Fe(II) adsorption behavior on fine-grained hematite powders. This
	suggests that Fe(II) plays a catalytic role, in which an electron
	from an adsorbed Fe(II) migrates to and reduces a lattice Fe(III)
	cation elsewhere, which subsequently desorbs in a scenario with zero
	net reduction and zero net adsorption. Given the general pH-independence

	measurements were used to determine the registry of adsorbed arsenate
	to the hematite structure, and thus the binding site and geometry
	of the resulting surface complex. Arsenate forms a bridging bidentate
	complex on two adjacent singly coordinated oxygen groups on each
	of the two distinct terminations present at the hematite surface.
	Although this geometry is consistent with that seen in past studies,

  abstract = {The subtropical to equatorial Atlantic Ocean provides a unique regime
	in which one can examine the biogeochemical cycles of antimony and
	arsenic. In particular, this region is strongly affected by inputs
	from the Amazon River and dust from North Africa at the surface,
	and horizontal transport at depth from high-latitude northern (e.g.,
	North Atlantic Deep Water) and southern waters (e.g., Antarctic Bottom
	and Intermediate Waters). As a part of the 1996 Intergovernmental
	Oceanographic Commission's Contaminant Baseline Survey, data for
	dissolved As(III+V), As(III), mono- and dimethyl arsenic, Sb(III+V),
	Sb(III), and monomethyl antimony were obtained at six vertical profile
	stations and 44 sites along the 11,000&#xa0;km transect from Montevideo,
	Uruguay, to Bridgetown, Barbados. The arsenic results were similar
	to those in other oceans, with moderate surface depletion, deep-water
	enrichment, a predominance of arsenate (&gt;85% As(V)), and methylated
	arsenic species and As(III) in surface waters that are likely a result
	of phytoplankton conversions to mitigate arsenate â€œstressâ€� (toxicity).
	Perhaps the most significant discovery in the arsenic results was
	the extremely low concentrations in the Amazon Plume (as low as 9.8&#xa0;nmol/l)
	that appear to extend for considerable distances offshore in the
	equatorial region. The very low concentration of inorganic arsenic
	in the Amazon River (2.8&#xa0;nmol/l; about half those in most rivers)
	is probably the result of intense iron oxyhydroxide scavenging. Dissolved
	antimony was also primarily in the pentavalent state (&gt;95% antimonate),
	but Sb(III) and monomethyl antimony were only detected in surface
	waters and displayed no correlations with biotic tracers such as
	nutrients and chlorophyll a. Unlike As(III+V)'s nutrient-type vertical
	profiles, Sb(III+V) displayed surface maxima and decreased into the
	deep waters, exhibiting the behavior of a scavenged element with
	a strong atmospheric input. While surface water Sb had a slight correlation
	with dissolved Al, it is likely that atmospheric Sb is delivered
	with combustion by-products and not from mineral aerosols. In the
	Amazon Plume, antimony concentrations dropped substantially, and
	an Amazon River sample had a concentration (0.25&#xa0;nmol/l) that
	was less than one-fourth those found in other major rivers. Using
	these river data, and estimates of atmospheric fluxes based on shipboard
	measurements and collections from Barbados, the atmospheric deposition
	of antimony to the equatorial Atlantic (2Â°Sâ€“8Â°N) is twice the
	Amazon flux, while the atmospheric deposition of arsenic is only
	10% of the river's flux.},

	of the properties of lead(II) compounds motivated partly by the necessity
	of understanding the Pb(II) binding preferences for the design of
	selective chelation therapy agents [2–6] and remediation of waters
	and soils.
	
	
	Another topic of interest is associated with the occurrence in Pb(II)
	compounds of a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons (LP,
	E) and its effect on the stereochemistry and properties of solid-state

	identiﬁable void (or gap) in the distribution of bonds to the ligands”.
	
	
	#VSEPR

	#geometry of AX3E
	
	The molecules and complexes of composition AX3E (CN A (3 + E)) (E:
	lone pair of electrons) have a trigonal-pyramidal geometry with the
	metal atom in the apical vertex. The coordination polyhedron of the
	A atom is predicted to have a -tetrahedral conﬁguration (I) with
	the X–Pb–X angle less than an ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5 ◦
	
	
	Among the 98 crystal structures of Pb(II) complexes with O-donor ligands
	investigated in this work, only the structures of 10 compounds (12
	types of Pb atoms) contain the Pb(II) atom with the CN (3 + E) +m
	and the -tetrahedral coordination geometry (Table 8). The lengths
	of the primary Pb–O bonds in Pb(II) complexes with CN (3 + E) +m
	fall into the range 2.25–2.53 Å with the average value of 2.40 Å.
	The values of the bond angles O–Pb–O vary in the range 68.37–88.88
	◦ (Tables 2-6), much less than the value of the bond angle in an
	ideal tetrahedron (109.5◦), conﬁrming a -tetrahedral coordination
	geometry of the Pb(II) atom in these compounds.
	
	
	#geometry of AX4E
	
	Structures of Pb(II) complexes where the Pb atom has CN (4 + E) +m
	should have a -trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry according
	to the VSEPR model. Among the studied crystal structures, complexes
	with O-donor ligands and CN (4 + E) +m are highly represented (54
	structures) (Table 9). Due to the effect of the stereochemically
	active lone pair, the axial lengths Pb–Oax in the - trigonal bipyramidal
	coordination polyhedra of Pb atoms are larger than the equatorial
	bond lengths while the values of the axial and equatorial angles
	become less than 180 ◦ and 120 ◦ as expected for a
	
	regular trigonal bipyramid. As seen from Tables 2–6, the structural
	parameters of the Pb atoms with CN (4 + E) +m are in full agreement
	with the VSEPR model for the -trigonal-bipyramidal coordination
	geometry.
	
	
	#Van der Waals radii of pb-o
	
	According to Bondi [29], the sum of the van der Waals radii of Pb
	and O is equal to 3.54 Å. In the present work the limiting value
	for a Pb–O bond is considered as 3.30 Å.
	
	
	The large Pb2+ ionic radius (1.19 Å [29]) facilitates the formation
	of compounds with CNs of the central atom ranging from 2 up to 12
	[15].
	
	
	#primary and secondary bond
	
	The common feature of the crystal structures of Pb(II) complexes with
	O-donor atom ligands and the stereochemically active lone pair of
	electrons is the presence of two ranges of Pb–O bond lengths in these
	complexes, the so-called primary and secondary bonds. The primary
	bonds have a large share of covalent character (donor–acceptor) while
	the secondary bonds are to a great extent ionic, in most cases they
	are bridging and serve to unite complexes into chains, layers or
	three-dimensional networks.
	
	
	Based on the presence of two Pb–O bond length ranges in the structures
	of Pb(II) complexes, the CN of the Pb atom in these complexes can
	be divided into two components: the CN of the Pb atomof the ﬁrst
	coordination sphere, taking into account the stereochemically active
	lone pair of electrons (n + E) (n: the number of Pb–O primary bonds),
	and the number of secondary bonds (m).},

  abstract = { Arsenic derived from natural sources occurs in groundwater in many
	countries, affecting the health of millions of people. The combined
	effects of As(V) reduction and diagenesis of iron oxide minerals
	on arsenic mobility are investigated in this study by comparing As(V)
	and As(III) sorption onto amorphous iron oxide (HFO), goethite, and
	magnetite at varying solution compositions. Experimental data are
	modeled with a diffuse double layer surface complexation model, and
	the extracted model parameters are used to examine the consistency
	of our results with those previously reported. Sorption of As(V)
	onto HFO and goethite is more favorable than that of As(III) below
	pH 5âˆ’6, whereas, above pH 7âˆ’8, As(III) has a higher affinity
	for the solids. The pH at which As(V) and As(III) are equally sorbed
	depends on the solid-to-solution ratio and type and specific surface
	area of the minerals and is shifted to lower pH values in the presence
	of phosphate, which competes for sorption sites. The sorption data
	indicate that, under most of the chemical conditions investigated
	in this study, reduction of As(V) in the presence of HFO or goethite
	would have only minor effects on or even decrease its mobility in
	the environment at near-neutral pH conditions. As(V) and As(III)
	sorption isotherms indicate similar surface site densities on the
	three oxides. Intrinsic surface complexation constants for As(V)
	are higher for goethite than HFO, whereas As(III) binding is similar
	for both of these oxides and also for magnetite. However, decrease
	in specific surface area and hence sorption site density that accompanies
	transformation of amorphous iron oxides to more crystalline phases
	could increase arsenic mobility. },

  abstract = {Few studies have combined molecular- and macroscopic-scale investigations
	with surface complexation model (SCM) development to predict trace
	metal speciation and partitioning in aqueous systems over a broad
	range of conditions. In this work, an extensive collection of new
	macroscopic and spectroscopic data was used to assess the ability
	of the modified triple-layer model (TLM) to predict single-solute
	lead(II) [Pb(II)] sorption onto 2-line ferrihydrite in NaNO3 solutions
	as a function of pH, ionic strength, and concentration. Regression
	of constant-pH isotherm data together with potentiometric titration
	and pH edge data was a much more rigorous test of the TLM than fitting
	pH edge data alone. When combined with spectroscopic data, the choices
	of feasible surface species/site types were limited to a few. In
	agreement with the spectroscopic data, very good fits of the isotherm
	data were obtained with a two-species, one-site model using the bidentate-mononuclear/monodentate-mononuclear
	species pairs, (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOHPb2+ and (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOPb+âˆ’NO3-.
	Regressing edge data in the absence of isotherm and spectroscopic
	data resulted in a fair number of surface-species/site-type combinations
	that provided acceptable fits of the edge data but unacceptable fits
	of the isotherm data. Surprisingly, best-fit equilibrium â€œconstantsâ€�
	for the Pb(II) surface complexes required adjustment outside the
	pH range of 4.5âˆ’5.5 in order to fit the isotherm data. In addition,
	a surface activity term was needed to reduce the ionic strength dependence
	of sorption for the species pair, (â‰¡FeO)2Pb/â‰¡FeOHPb2+. In light
	of this, the ability of existing SCMs to predict Pb(II) sorption
	onto 2-line ferrihydrite over a wide range of conditions seems questionable.
	While many advances have been made over the past decade, much work
	still needs to be done in fine-tuning the thermodynamic framework
	and databases for the SCMs.},

	and environmental processes, but also in fields ranging from corrosion
	to photocatalysis. The structure of α-Fe2O3 (001) surfaces is not
	fully understood, and questions have arisen recently concerning different
	terminations of (001) terraces; a so-called Fe-termination is expected,
	but under some conditions an O-termination may also be possible.
	Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) studies
	report evidence for an O-termination in coexistence with an Fe-termination,
	but other studies find no evidence for an O-termination. Molecular
	mechanics studies suggest that an O-termination should be possible
	in an aqueous environment. An O-termination could result from dissolution;
	if Fe atoms were to dissolve from an Fe-termination, an O-termination
	would presumably result (and vice-versa). We imaged hematite (001)
	surfaces in air and aqueous solution using STM. To aid interpretation
	of the images, we use a resonant tunneling model (RTM) parameterized
	using ab initio calculations.
	
	Our STM and RTM results are consistent with mixed O- and Fe-terminated
	(001) surfaces. For acid-etched surfaces we find evidence for a periodic
	(with wavelength of 2.2 ± 0.2 nm) arrangement of nominal O- and Fe-terminated
	domains. Two different borders between domains should occur, one
	in which the Fe-termination is high relative to the O-termination,
	and the reverse. The different domain borders have significantly
	different heights, consistent with RTM calculations. This agreement
	allows us to conclude that the Fe-termination is topographically
	high on most terraces. Surface domains are observed in aqueous solutions
	at the atomic scale, and appear to be very unreactive on tens-of-seconds
	time scales at pH 1.},

	and its compounds are considered to be priority pollutants interest
	by the USEPA and the EU. In this first review paper on antimony occurrence
	in natural waters, 420 papers on freshwaters, marine waters, estuaries,
	soils, and sediments have been reviewed. All data are quoted from
	the original sources. Typical concentrations of total dissolved antimony
	are usually less than 1.0 Î¼g/l in non-polluted waters. When redox
	speciation determinations are performed, most studies report the
	dominance of Sb(V) under oxic conditions. However, the presence of
	significant proportions of Sb(III) is sometimes detected. This is
	in contrast with thermodynamic equilibrium predictions and discrepancies
	are often attributed to biological activity or kinetic effects but
	proofs are lacking. Similarly, the existence of Sb(V), although not
	thermodynamically predicted, is often reported under anoxic conditions.
	Low concentrations of methylated antimony species are mentioned in
	a few studies. Antimony is not considered to be a highly reactive
	element in oceans, with concentrations of the order of 200 ng/l.
	In estuarine waters, both conservative and non-conservative behaviours
	are reported depending on the estuaries' characteristics. Elevated
	concentrations of antimony in soils and sediments are either related
	to anthropogenic sources or associated with high arsenic concentrations
	in sulfidic ores. Antimony appears to be highly unreactive in soils.
	Low accumulation factors are reported in algae. Airborne supply of
	antimony to aquatic and terrestrial systems seems to be important

  abstract = { Electron transfer and atom exchange (ETAE) between aqueous Fe(II)
	and Fe(III) oxides induces surface growth and dissolution that affects
	trace element fate and transport. We have recently demonstrated Ni(II)
	cycling through goethite and hematite (adsorbed Ni incorporates into
	the mineral structure and preincorporated Ni releases to solution)
	during Fe(II)â€“Fe(III) ETAE. However, the chemical parameters affecting
	net trace element release remain unknown. Here, we examine the chemical
	controls on Ni(II) and Zn(II) release from Ni- and Zn-substituted
	goethite and hematite during reaction with Fe(II). Release follows
	a rate law consistent with surface reaction limited mineral dissolution
	and suggests that release occurs near sites of Fe(III) reductive
	dissolution during Fe(II)â€“Fe(III) ETAE. Metal substituent type
	affects reactivity; Zn release is more pronounced from hematite than
	goethite, whereas the opposite trend occurs for Ni. Buildup of Ni
	or Zn in solution inhibits further release but this resumes upon
	fluid exchange, suggesting that sustained release is possible under
	flow conditions. Mineral and aqueous Fe(II) concentrations as well
	as pH strongly affect sorbed Fe(II) concentrations, which directly
	control the reaction rates and final metal concentrations. Our results
	demonstrate that structurally incorporated trace elements are mobilized
	from iron oxides into fluids without abiotic or microbial net iron
	reduction. Such release may affect micronutrient availability, contaminant
	transport, and the distribution of redox-inactive trace elements
	in natural and engineered systems. },

	Introduction
	
	Chemical reactions at the goethite/water interface play an important
	role in numerous natural processes, from controlling the fate and
	transport of environmental contaminants (Hays et al., 1987; Brown
	et al., 1999; Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003) to the biological availability
	and geochemical cycling of iron.
	
	Interfacial processes at model surfaces are frequently studied to
	understand and interpret many types of macroscopic observations driven
	by heterogeneous reaction pathways. However, such studies are hampered
	by the limited molecular knowledge of the aqueous interface structure.
	
	Structural information of this type is crucial because reactivity
	is critically controlled by the precise nature of the surface functional
	groups and the structure or distribution of water and electrolyte
	at the solid-solution interface
	
	
	surface structure of minerals can vary markedly from the bulk stoichiometric
	termination of the crystal lattice, and that water at the interface
	may show ordering that is significantly different from bulk water
	molecular arrangements
	
	
	While the various models have generally proved to have predictive
	power, and provide a qualitative structural interpretation of reactivity,
	we know
	
	that reduction in surface free energy drives relaxations of near surface
	atoms, possible deviation of stoichiometry at the surface, and specific
	surface proton stoichiometry, all of which can have major effects
	on surface reactivity.
	
	
	Ordering of interfacial water and associated reduction in the interfacial
	dielectric permittivity may affect sorption behavior markedly.
	
	
	This approach can only yield incomplete geochemical insight as reactivity
	is neither connected to an accurate model of interfacial structure,
	nor is it being observed for a particular set of interfaces.
	
	
	In this article we present the experimental determination of the three
	dimensional atomic structure of goethite/water interface.
	
	
	we have refined the three-dimensional positions of both surface atoms
	and overlayer water oxygens
	
	
	Using bond-valence analysis, we have assigned the protonation states
	of the surface oxygens, from which we can infer the orientation of
	the surface hydrogen bonding network.},

  abstract = {The long-recognized risk to human health arising from arsenic-contaminated
	waters is known to be linked to partitioning reactions between arsenic
	and natural solid phases. Currently, the ability to predict As surface
	complexation is limited by the lack of molecular-level understanding
	of As-solid interactions. In the present study, we use density functional
	theory (DFT) to model mono-, bi-, and tri-dentate As(iii) surface
	complexes on different (previously proposed) structural models for
	hydrated hematite, modeled as [small alpha]-Fe2O3(0001)-water interfaces.
	One of the modeled hematite-water interfaces is terminated entirely
	by hydroxyl surface functional groups, comprised of hematite lattice
	oxygen atoms. The other hematite-water interface is an iron-terminated
	model in which the outermost oxygen functional groups are water (and
	water dissociation product) ligands. We report the DFT trends in
	adsorption energies in terms of As-hematite coordination, hematite
	surface geometry/stoichiometry, and oxygen functional group identity.
	The DFT energetics predict that a monodentate As(iii) surface complex
	is preferred on both hematite-water structures, suggesting that the
	two structural models here employed do not sufficiently represent
	the true surface structure to reproduce the experimental observation
	of As(iii) bidentate coordination. However, the results do elucidate
	fundamental concepts of interface reactivity: A key result, supported
	by electronic structure analysis, is that ligand oxygen functional
	groups cannot be treated on equal ground with true surface oxygen
	functional groups. For the systems modeled here the distinction between
	surface and ligand functional groups supersedes the differences in
	oxygen coordination with surface Fe. We discuss the impact of this
	finding on the application of bond-valence-based predictions of mineral-water
	reactivity, and use the results of this study to pose questions and
	directions for ongoing modeling efforts aimed at linking macroscopic
	reactivity with molecular-level understanding.},

	distance of 2.04 Â± 0.02 Ã… at low sorption densities (Î“ â‰¤ 1.1
	?mol/m2). On the basis of EXAFS-derived Zn?Fe3+ distances of (3.10?3.12)

	on octahedral Fe3+(O,OH)6 or pentahedral Fe3+(O,OH)5 surface sites
	on HN as inner-sphere, mononuclear, bidentate, edge-sharing adsorption
	complexes at these low sorption densities. It is possible that polynuclear
	Zn complexes are also present because of the similarity of Zn and
	Fe backscattering. At higher Zn(II) sorption densities on hematite
	nanoparticles (Î“ â‰¥ 3.38 ?mol/m2), we observed the formation of
	Zn(O,OH)6 surface complexes, with an average Zn?O distance of 2.09
	Â± 0.02 Ã…, a Zn?Zn distance of 3.16 Â± 0.02 Ã…, and a linear multiple-scattering
	feature at 6.12 Â± 0.06 Ã…. Formation of a Zn(OH)2(am) precipitate
	for the higher sorption density samples (Î“ â‰¥ 3.38 ?mol/m2) is
	suggested on the basis of comparison of the EXAFS spectra of the
	sorption samples with that of synthetic Zn(OH)2(am). In contrast,
	EXAFS spectra of Zn(II) sorbed on hematite microparticles (HM) under
	similar experimental conditions showed no evidence of surface precipitates
	even at the same total [Zn(II)(aq)] that resulted in precipitate
	formation in the nanoparticle system. Instead, Zn(O,OH)6 octahedra
	(d(Zn?O) = 2.10 Â± 0.02 Ã…) were found to sorb dominantly in an inner-sphere,
	bidentate, edge-sharing fashion on Fe3+(O,OH)6 octahedra at hematite
	microparticle surfaces, based on an EXAFS-derived Zn?Fe3+ distance
	of 3.44 Â± 0.02 Ã…. CaCl2 selective extraction experiments showed
	that 10?15% of the sorbed Zn(II) was released from Zn/HN sorption
	samples, and about 40% was released from a Zn/HM sorption sample.
	These fractions of Zn(II) are interpreted as weakly bound, outer-sphere
	adsorption complexes. The combined EXAFS and selective chemical extraction
	results indicate that (1) both Zn(O,OH)4 and Zn(O,OH)6 adsorption
	complexes are present in the Zn/HN system, whereas dominantly Zn(O,OH)6
	adsorption complexes are present in the Zn/HM system; (2) a higher
	proportion of outer-sphere Zn(II) surface complexes is present in
	the Zn/HM system; and (3) Zn-containing precipitates similar to Zn(OH)2(am)
	form in the nanoparticle system but not in the microparticle system,
	suggesting a difference in reactivity of the hematite nanoparticles
	vs microparticles with respect to Zn(II)(aq).},

	at [Zn(II)(aq)]tot > 4 mM. In contrast, Zn(II) uptake for the Zn(II)/HM
	binary system is a factor of 2 greater than that for the Zn(II)/Ox/HM

	Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) results are consistent with
	the presence of inner-sphere oxalate complexes and outer-sphere ZnOx(aq)

	X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic results suggest
	that type A ternary surface complexes (i.e., >O2âˆ’Znâˆ’Ox) are present.
	In the Zn(II)/Ox/HN ternary system at R = 0.15, ATR-FTIR results
	indicate the presence of inner-sphere oxalate and outer-sphere ZnOx(aq)
	complexes; the EXAFS results provide no evidence for inner-sphere
	Zn(II) complexes or type A ternary complexes. In contrast, ATR-FTIR
	results for the Zn/Ox/HN sample with R = 0.68 are consistent with
	a ZnOx(s)-like surface precipitate and possibly type B ternary surface
	complexes (i.e., >O2âˆ’Oxâˆ’Zn). EXAFS results are also consistent
	with the presence of ZnOx(s)-like precipitates. We ascribe the observed
	increase of Zn(II)(aq) uptake in the Zn(II)/Ox/HN ternary system
	at [Zn(II)(aq)]tot â‰¥ 4 mM relative to the Zn(II)/Ox/HM ternary

  abstract = {A review. Trace elements mean elements present at low concns. (mg
	kg-1 or less) in agroecosystems. Some trace elements, including copper
	(Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo), and
	boron (B) are essential to plant growth and are called micronutrients.
	Except for B, these elements are also heavy metals, and are toxic
	to plants at high concns. Some trace elements, such as cobalt (Co)
	and selenium (Se), are not essential to plant growth but are required
	by animals and human beings. Other trace elements such as cadmium
	(Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), and arsenic
	(As) have toxic effects on living organisms and are often considered
	as contaminants. Trace elements in an agroecosystem are either inherited
	from soil parent materials or inputs through human activities. Soil
	contamination with heavy metals and toxic elements due to parent
	materials or point sources often occurs in a limited area and is
	easy to identify. Repeated use of metal-enriched chems., fertilizers,
	and org. amendments such as sewage sludge as well as wastewater may
	cause contamination at a large scale. A good example is the increased
	concn. of Cu and Zn in soils under long-term prodn. of citrus and
	other fruit crops. Many chem. processes are involved in the transformation
	of trace elements in soils, but pptn.-dissoln., adsorption-desorption,
	and complexation are the most important processes controlling bioavailability
	and mobility of trace elements in soils. Both deficiency and toxicity
	of trace elements occur in agroecosystems. Application of trace elements
	in fertilizers is effective in correcting micronutrient deficiencies
	for crop prodn., whereas remediation of soils contaminated with metals
	is still costly and difficult although phytoremediation appears promising
	as a cost-effective approach. Soil microorganisms are the first living
	organisms subjected to the impacts of metal contamination. Being
	responsive and sensitive, changes in microbial biomass, activity,
	and community structure as a result of increased metal concn. in
	soil may be used as indicators of soil contamination or soil environmental
	quality. Future research needs to focus on the balance of trace elements
	in an agroecosystem, elaboration of soil chem. and biochem. parameters

	in trace elements, and quantification of trace metal transport from

	(LEED) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS)
	in the temperature range between 100 and 950&#xa0;K. The (1Ã—1) surface
	is fully oxidized and has a bulk-like concentration and structure
	of cation and anion sites. After vacuum annealing at 950&#xa0;K a
	(2Ã—1) pattern is observed in LEED. Although the structure of the
	(2Ã—1) surface is not fully understood, it possesses a greater surface
	concentration of cation sites than the (1Ã—1) surface, some of which
	are probably reduced. H2O adsorbs dissociatively on both surfaces
	as evidenced by HREELS losses at 3625 and 960&#xa0;cmâˆ’1 due to
	the stretching and bending modes of terminal hydroxyl groups. These
	losses shift as expected for D2O. Bridging hydroxyls are also formed
	by proton transfer to bridging oxygen anion sites from dissociating
	water molecules, but have a poorly resolved Oâ€“H stretch at 3400&#xa0;cmâˆ’1
	suggesting they are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions. Further
	evidence for water dissociation on both surfaces comes from isotopic
	scrambling of oxygen between these hydroxyls and the 18O-enriched
	surfaces. Although both surfaces dissociate water, the structural
	differences between the (1Ã—1) and (2Ã—1) surfaces result in different
	ratios of molecular-to-dissociative water. Terminal hydroxyls occupy
	roughly 6Ã—1014 sites&#xa0;cmâˆ’2 on the (1Ã—1) surface, but only
	about 4.5Ã—1014 sites&#xa0;cmâˆ’2 on the (2Ã—1) surface. The balance
	of available cation sites bind molecular water that evolves in TPD
	below 300&#xa0;K from either surface. This molecular water is readily
	detected in both HREELS and SSIMS. The surface structure also influences
	the hydroxyl recombinative desorption kinetics. Terminal and bridging
	hydroxyls recombine to liberate water in TPD at 350&#xa0;K from the
	(1Ã—1) surface and at 405&#xa0;K from the (2Ã—1) surface. The recombinative
	desorption state of water at 350&#xa0;K from the (1Ã—1) surface exhibits
	first-order desorption kinetics with an activation energy of about
	120&#xa0;kJ&#xa0;molâˆ’1 and a pre-exponential of 1Ã—1017&#xa0;sâˆ’1.
	The first-order behavior and the high pre-exponential suggests that
	recombinative desorption from the (1Ã—1) surface involves pairing
	of bridging and terminal hydroxyl groups. In contrast, recombinative
	desorption from the (2Ã—1) surface is pseudo-zeroth order in appearance
	suggesting that hydroxyls are bound in one-dimensional arrays with
	desorption occurring preferentially at the ends of each array.},

	at Sb mines is a&#xa0;significant problem in Slovakia. This study
	is focused on the environmental effects of the 5 abandoned Sb mines
	on water, stream sediment and soil since the mines are situated in
	the close vicinity of residential areas. Samples of mine wastes,
	various types of waters, stream sediments, soils, and leachates of
	the mine wastes, stream sediments and selected soils were analyzed
	for As and Sb to evaluate their geochemical dispersion from the mines.
	Mine wastes collected at the mine sites contained up to 5166&#xa0;mg/kg
	As and 9861&#xa0;mg/kg Sb. Arsenic in mine wastes was associated
	mostly with Fe oxides, whereas Sb was present frequently in the form
	of individual Sb, Sb(Fe) and Fe(Sb) oxides. Waters of different types
	such as groundwater, surface waters and mine waters, all contained
	elevated concentrations of As and Sb, reaching up to 2150&#xa0;Î¼g/L
	As and 9300&#xa0;Î¼g/L Sb, and had circum-neutral pH values because
	of the buffering capacity of abundant Ca- and Mg-carbonates. The
	concentrations of Sb in several household wells are a cause for concern,
	exceeding the Sb drinking water limit of 5&#xa0;Î¼g/L by as much
	as 25&#xa0;times. Some attenuation of the As and Sb concentrations
	in mine and impoundment waters was expected because of the deposition
	of metalloids onto hydrous ferric oxides built up below adit entrances
	and impoundment discharges. These HFOs contained&#xa0;&gt;20&#xa0;wt.%
	As and 1.5&#xa0;wt.% Sb. Stream sediments and soils have also been
	contaminated by As and Sb with the peak concentrations generally
	found near open adits and mine wastes. In addition to the discharged
	waters from open adits, the significant source of As and Sb contamination
	are waste-rock dumps and tailings impoundments. Leachates from mine
	wastes contained as much as 8400&#xa0;Î¼g/L As and 4060&#xa0;Î¼g/L
	Sb, suggesting that the mine wastes would have a great potential
	to contaminate the downstream environment. Moreover, the results
	of water leaching tests showed that Sb was released from the solids
	more efficiently than As under oxidizing conditions. This might partly
	explain the predominance of Sb over As in most water samples.},

	and co-precipitation of As has been studied extensively for synthetic
	Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide minerals but is less documented for biogenic
	ones. In the present study, we used Fe and As K-edge X-ray Absorption
	Near Edge Structure (XANES), extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
	(EXAFS) spectroscopy, MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM in order
	to investigate the interactions of As(V) and As(III) with biogenic
	Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide minerals formed by the nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing
	bacterium Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1. The present results show
	the As immobilization potential of strain BoFeN1 as well as the influence
	of As(III) and As(V) on biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide formation.
	In the absence of As, and at low As loading (As:Fe&#xa0;â‰¤&#xa0;0.008&#xa0;mol/mol),
	goethite (Gt) formed exclusively. In contrast, at higher As/Fe ratios
	(As:Fe&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020â€“0.067), a ferrihydrite (Fh) phase also
	formed, and its relative amount systematically increased with increasing
	As:Fe ratio, this effect being stronger for As(V) than for As(III).
	Therefore, we conclude that the presence of As influences the type
	of biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide minerals formed during microbial
	Fe(II) oxidation. Arsenic-K-edge EXAFS analysis of biogenic Asâ€“Feâ€“mineral
	co-precipitates indicates that both As(V) and As(III) form inner-sphere
	surface complexes at the surface of the biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides.
	Differences observed between As-surface complexes in BoFeN1-produced
	Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide samples and in abiotic model compounds suggest
	that associated organic exopolymers in our biogenic samples may compete
	with As oxoanions for sorption on Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides surfaces.
	In addition HRTEMâ€“EDXS analysis suggests that As(V) preferentially
	binds to poorly crystalline phases, such as ferrihydrite, while As(III)
	did not show any preferential association regarding Fh or Gt.},

  abstract = {Oxidation state is a major factor affecting the mobility of arsenic
	(As) and antimony (Sb) in soil and aquatic systems. Metal (hydr)oxides
	and clay minerals are effective sorbents, and may also promote redox
	reactions on their surfaces via direct or indirect facilitation of
	electron transfer. Iron substituted for Al in the octahedral sites
	of aluminosilicate clay minerals has the potential to be in variable
	oxidation states and is a key constituent of electron transfer reactions
	in clay minerals. This experimental work was conducted to determine
	whether structural Fe in clays can affect the oxidation state of
	As and Sb adsorbed at the clay surface. Another goal of our study
	was to compare the reactivity of clay structural Fe(II) with systems
	containing Fe(II) present in dissolved/adsorbed forms.
	
	The experimental systems included batch reactors with various concentrations
	of As(III), Sb(III), As(V), or Sb(V) equilibrated with oxidized (NAu-1)
	or partially reduced (NAu-1-Red) nontronite, hydrous aluminum oxide
	(HAO) and kaolinite (KGa-1b) suspensions under oxic and anoxic conditions.
	The reaction times ranged from 0.5 to 720&#xa0;h, and pH was constrained
	at 5.5 (for As) and at 5.5 or 8.0 (for Sb). The oxidation state of
	As and Sb in the liquid phase was determined by liquid chromatography
	in line with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, and
	in the solid phase by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our findings
	show that structural Fe(II) in NAu-1-Red was not able to reduce As(V)/Sb(V)
	under the conditions examined, but reduction was seen when aqueous
	Fe(II) was present in the systems with kaolinite (KGa-1b) and nontronite
	(NAu-1). The ability of the structural Fe in nontronite clay NAu-1
	to promote oxidation of As(III)/Sb(III) was greatly affected by its
	oxidation state: if all structural Fe was in the oxidized Fe(III)
	form, no oxidation was observed; however, when the clay was partially
	reduced (âˆ¼20% of structural Fe was reduced to Fe(II)), NAu-1-Red
	promoted the most extensive oxidation under both oxic and anoxic
	conditions. Electron balance considerations suggest that structural
	Fe(III) in the NAu-1-Red was the sole oxidant in the anoxic setup,
	while dissolved O2 also contributes in oxic conditions. Long-term
	batch experiments revealed the complex dynamics of As aqueous speciation
	in anoxic and oxic systems when reduced arsenic was initially added:
	rapid disappearance of As(III) was observed due to oxidation to As(V)
	followed by a slow increase of aqueous As(III). This behavior is
	explained by two reactions: fast initial oxidation of As(III) by
	structural Fe(III) (anoxic) or Fe(III) and dissolved O2 (oxic) followed
	by the slow reduction of As(V) by dissolved Fe(II). The resulting
	re-mobilization of As due to As(V) reduction by aqueous Fe(II) occurs
	on time scales on the order of days. These reactions are likely significant
	in a natural soil or aquifer environment with seasonal cycling or
	slightly reducing conditions with an abundance of clay minerals and
	dissolved Fe(II).},

  abstract = {Contamination of shooting range soils from the use of Pb bullets is
	under increasing scrutiny. Past research on Pb contamination of shooting
	ranges has focused on weathering reactions of Pb bullets in soil.
	The objective of this study was to determine the significance of
	abrasion of Pb bullets in contributing to soil Pb contamination.
	This was accomplished by firing a known mass of bullets into sand
	and analyzing for total Pb after removing bullets, through field
	sampling of a newly opened shooting range, and a laboratory weathering
	study. Forty-one mg of Pb were abraded per bullet as it passed through
	the sand, which accounted for 1.5% of the bullet mass being physically
	removed. At a shooting range that had been open for 3 months, the
	highest Pb concentration from the pistol range berm soil was 193
	mg/kg at 0.5 m height, and from the rifle range berm soil was 1142
	mg/kg at 1.0 m height. Most soils from the field abrasion experiment
	as well as soil collected from the rifle range had SPLP-Pb &gt;15
	Î¼g/l (Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure). Typically, Pb
	concentration in the rifle range was greater than that of the pistol
	range. Based on a laboratory weathering study, virtually all metallic
	Pb was converted to hydrocerussite (Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2), as well as to
	a lesser extent cerussite (PbCO3) and massicot (PbO) within one week.
	Our study demonstrated that abrasion of lead bullets and their subsequent
	weathering can be a significant source of lead contamination in soils
	of a newly opened shooting range.},

	controlling factor in interfacial reactions such as foreign ion incorporation,

	simulations with four different models based on interatomic potentials
	have been carried out to determine the atomic-level structure of
	three hematiteâ€“water interfaces. In addition, for each of the three
	surfaces, different terminations or protonation schemes were considered.
	The availability of surface X-ray scattering data for the surfaces
	considered here allowed for an extensive comparison with experimental
	data. Qualitatively, with the exception of one termination with one
	model, all models predict the correct arrangement of water molecules
	at the interface. Quantitatively, the agreement with experimental

	studies. Therefore, this study provides further evidence that interatomic
	potential models can be used to reliably predict the structure of
	mineralâ€“water interfaces. In addition, molecular simulations are
	a valuable source of information to complement surface X-ray scattering
	experiments owing to their ability to directly determine the position
	of hydrogen atoms and to yield three-dimensional predicted structures

	the sorbed malonate species is directly coordinated to surface Fe
	atoms in an inner-sphere mode. In the presence of Pb, little change
	is seen in the IR spectrum for sorbed malonate, indicating that geometry
	of malonate as it coordinates to sorbed Pb(II) adions is similar
	to the geometry of malonate as it coordinates to Fe in the hematite
	surface. Fits of the raw EXAFS spectra collected from pH 4 to pH
	8 result in average Pbâ€“C distances of 2.98 to 3.14 Ã…, suggesting
	the presence of both four- and six-membered Pbâ€“malonate rings.
	The IR results are consistent with this interpretation. Thus, our

	Protection Agency of the United States (USEPA). Oxidation processes
	critically affect the mobility of antimony in the environment since
	Sb(V) has a greater solubility than Sb(III). In this study, the co-oxidation
	reactions of Sb(III) with Fe(II) and both O2 and H2O2 were investigated
	and compared to those of As(III). With increasing pH, the oxidation
	rate coefficients of Sb(III) in the presence of Fe(II) and O2 increased
	and followed a similar pH trend as the Fe(II) oxidation by O2. Half-lives
	of Sb(III) were 35 and 1.4 h at pH 5.0 and pH 6.2, respectively.
	The co-oxidation with Fe(II) and H2O2 is about 7000 and 20 times
	faster than with Fe(II) and O2 at pH 3 and pH 7, respectively. For
	both systems, â€¢OH radicals appear to be the predominant oxidant
	below approximately pH 4, while at more neutral pH values, other
	unknown intermediates become important. The oxidation of As(III)
	follows a similar pH trend as the Sb(III) oxidation; however, As(III)
	oxidation was roughly 10 times slower and only partly oxidized in
	most of the experiments. This study shows that the Fe(II)-mediated
	oxidation of Sb(III) can be an important oxidation pathway at neutral

	applications, even though Sb compounds are classified as priority
	pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States.
	Iron (Fe) hydroxides appear to be important sorbents for Sb in soils
	and sediments, but mineral surfaces can also catalyze oxidation processes
	and may thus mobilize Sb. The aim of this study was to investigate
	whether goethite immobilizes Sb by sorption or whether Sb(III) adsorbed
	on goethite is oxidized and then released. The sorption of both Sb(III)
	and Sb(V) on goethite was studied in 0.01 and 0.1 M KClO4 M solutions
	as a function of pH and Sb concentration. To monitor oxidation processes
	Sb species were measured in solution and in the solid phase. The
	results show that both Sb(III) and Sb(V) form inner-sphere surface
	complexes at the goethite surface. Antimony(III) strongly adsorbs
	on goethite over a wide pH range (3?12), whereas maximum Sb(V) adsorption
	is found below pH 7. At higher ionic strength, the desorption of
	Sb(V) is shifted to lower pH values, most likely due to the formation
	of ion pairs KSb(OH)6Â°. The sorption data of Sb(V) can be fitted
	by the modified triple-layer surface complexation model. Within 7
	days, Sb(III) adsorbed on goethite is partly oxidized at pH 3, 5.9
	and 9.7. The weak pH-dependence of the rate coefficients suggests
	that adsorbed Sb(III) is oxidized by O2 and that the coordination
	of Sb(III) to the surface increases the electron density of the Sb
	atom, which enhances the oxidation process. At pH values below pH
	7, the oxidation of Sb(III) did not mobilize Sb within 35 days, while
	30% of adsorbed Sb(III) was released into the solution at pH 9.9
	within the same time. The adsorption of Sb(III) on Fe hydroxides
	over a wide pH range may be a major pathway for the oxidation and
	release of Sb(V).},

	shotgun pellets to shooting range soils is significant in some countries.
	This paper presents the data of chemical and mineralogical analyses
	of soils and Pb-pellet crusts from five shooting ranges in Sweden
	and, based on these results, evaluates the retention of lead in these
	shooting range soils. In the soils, Pb-pellets and bullets are readily
	decomposed and transformed to crust materials composed of Pb-bearing
	minerals. The transformation products in the crust materials, identified
	by X-ray diffraction, are predominantly hydrocerussite [Pb3(CO3)2
	(OH)2], associated with cerussite (PbCO3) and anglesite (PbSO4).
	In a period of 20â€“25 years, an average of 4Â·8% metallic lead in
	the pellets has been transformed to lead carbonate and lead sulphate,
	where the former is the more stable mineral in the surface environment.
	However, in soils relatively rich in humus an average of 15Â·6% metallic
	lead in the pellets was transformed to secondary lead compounds in
	the same period. The results of the chemical analyses indicate that
	Pb is rather immobile in the soil profile. The surficial horizon
	contains higher concentrations of lead (52â€“3400 mg kgâˆ’1), while
	lower concentrations of lead were found in the E and B horizons where
	the total Pb concentrations (8â€“37 mg kgâˆ’1) are within about one
	standard deviation of the mean reference sample concentration. An
	inverse relationship is revealed between the aluminium hydroxide
	content of the soil fraction and EDTA-extractable Pb, which suggests
	that these compounds have affected the retention of lead.},

	may be incorrect due to an experimental artifact, though they give
	good simulations of experimental data. This may be due to the success
	of least-squares fitting programs such as FITEQL at finding model
	parameters to describe experimental data sets. Previous studies have
	shown that goethite (Î±-FeOOH) suspensions purged with CO2-free N2(g)
	for up to two months have measured points of zero net protonic charge
	(PZNPC) in the range 9.0-9.3, which is close to a theoretical value

	as the two intrinsic surface acidity constants pKinta1 and pKinta2

	are lower than those currently in use. These revised parameters are
	consistent with the removal of a carbonate surface complex from the

	that the adsorption of Sb(OH)6- ion from aqueous solutions onto an
	amorphous iron oxide particle film is accompanied by changes in the
	Sb(OH)6- spectrum and the loss of OH stretching absorptions from
	iron oxide surface hydroxyl groups. These spectral changes upon adsorption
	imply an inner-sphere surface interaction with the formation of Sbâˆ’Oâˆ’Fe

	from 8 to 3 follows that expected for anions on iron oxide considering
	its pH-dependent surface charge, with the greatest amount of adsorbed
	antimonate at pH 3. The study of adsorption/desorption kinetics showed
	a more rapid desorption of adsorbed antimonate under alkaline conditions.
	This trend is expected from the pH dependence of the antimonate charge
	and iron oxide surface charge, but it might be partly due to the
	fact that high pH favors hydrolysis of antimonate oligomers formed
	on the iron oxide surface from adsorption under acidic conditions.

	ferric iron (Fe) complexes of humic substances (HS) is often hypothesized
	to represent a major mechanism for As-HS interactions under oxic
	conditions. However, direct evidence for this potentially important
	binding mechanism is still lacking. To investigate the molecular-scale
	interaction between arsenate, As(V), and HS in the presence of Fe(III),
	we reacted fulvic and humic acids with Fe(III) (1 wt %) and equilibrated
	the Fe(III)-HS complexes formed with As(V) at pH 7 (molar Fe/As âˆ¼10).
	The local (<5 Ã…) coordination environments of As and Fe were subsequently
	studied by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results show
	that 4.5â€“12.5 Î¼mol As(V)/g HS (25â€“70% of total As) was associated
	with Fe(III). At least 70% of this As pool was bound to Fe(III)-HS
	complexes via inner-sphere complexation. Results obtained from shell
	fits of As K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
	spectra were consistent with a monodentate binuclear (2C) and monodentate
	mononuclear (1V) complex stabilized by H-bonds (RAsâ€“Fe = 3.30 Ã…).
	The analysis of Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra revealed that Fe in Fe(III)-HS
	complexes was predominantly present as oligomeric Fe(III) clusters
	at neutral pH. Shell-fit results complied with a structural motif
	in which three corner-sharing Fe(O,OH)6 octahedra linked by a single
	Î¼3-O bridge form a planar Fe trimer. In these complexes, the average
	Feâ€“C and Feâ€“Fe bond distances were 2.95 Ã… and 3.47 Ã…, respectively.
	Our study provides the first spectroscopic evidence for ternary complex
	formation between As(V) and Fe(III)-HS complexes, suggesting that
	this binding mechanism is of fundamental importance for the cycling
	of oxyanions such as As(V) in organic-rich, oxic soils and sediments.

  abstract = {Arsenic sorption onto iron oxide spinels such as magnetite could contribute
	to immobilization of arsenite (AsO33âˆ’), the reduced, highly toxic
	form of arsenic in contaminated anoxic groundwaters, as well as to
	putative remediation processes. Nanocrystalline magnetite (<20 nm)
	is known to exhibit higher efficiency for arsenite sorption than
	larger particles, sorbing as much as âˆ¼20 Î¼mol/m2 of arsenite.
	To improve our understanding of this process, we investigated the
	molecular level structure of As(III)-containing sorption products
	on two types of fine-grained magnetite: (1) a biogenic one with an
	average particle diameter of 34 nm produced by reduction of lepidocrocite
	(Î³-FeOOH) by Shewanella putrefaciens and (2) a synthetic, abiotic,
	nanocrystalline magnetite with an average particle diameter of 11
	nm. Results from extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) for
	both types of magnetite with As(III) surface coverages of up to 5
	Î¼mol/m2 indicate that As(III) forms dominantly inner-sphere, tridentate,
	hexanuclear, corner-sharing surface complexes (3C) in which AsO3
	pyramids occupy vacant tetrahedral sites on octahedrally terminated
	{111} surfaces of magnetite. Formation of this type of surface complex
	results in a decrease in dissolved As(III) concentration below the
	maximum concentration level recommended by the World Health Organization
	(10 Î¼g/L), which corresponds to As(III) surface coverages of 0.16
	and 0.19 Î¼mol/m2 in our experiments. In addition, high-resolution
	transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive
	X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analyses revealed the occurrence of an
	amorphous As(III)-rich surface precipitate forming at As(III) surface
	coverages as low as 1.61 Î¼mol/m2. This phase hosts the majority
	of adsorbed arsenite at surface coverages exceeding the theoretical
	maximum site density of vacant tetrahedral sites on the magnetite
	{111} surface (3.2 sites/nm2 or 5.3 Î¼mol/m2). This finding helps
	to explain the exceptional As(III) sorption capacity of nanocrystalline
	magnetite particles (>10 Î¼mol/m2). However, the higher solubility
	of the amorphous surface precipitate compared to the 3C surface complexes
	causes a dramatic increase of dissolved As concentration for coverages

	50 days. In pots without rice plants, flooding increased both the
	concn. of dissolved Sb (up to ca 2000 Î¼g L-1) and As (up to ca 1500
	Î¼g L-1). When rice was present, Fe plaque developing on rice roots
	acted as a scavenger for both As and Sb, whereby the concn. of As,
	but not Sb, in porewater decreased substantially. Dissolved Sb in
	porewater, which occurred mainly as Sb(V), correlated with Ca, indicating
	a soly. governed by Ca antimonate. No significant differences in
	bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor between Sb and As
	were obsd. Greater relative concn. of Sb(V) was found in rice shoots
	compared to rice root and porewater, indicating either a preferred
	uptake of Sb(V) or possibly an oxidn. of Sb(III) to Sb(V) in shoots.
	Adding soil amendments (olivine, hematite) to the paddy soil had
	no effect on Sb and As concns. in porewater. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  review = {#lead complexation in general:
	
	Lead(II) may either form hemidirected complexes with large bond distance
	distribution and an apparent gap for excess electron density, or
	holodirected ones with a symmetric coordination sphere with normal
	bond distance distribution, depending on the strength of antibonding
	lead 6s/ligand np molecular orbital interactions and ligand-ligand
	interactions.
	
	
	EXAFS data on the hydrated lead(II) ion in aqueous solution show broad
	bond distance distribution and a lack of inner-core multiple scattering
	contributions strongly indicating a hemidirected structure.
	
	
	The Pb-O bond distances found both by EXAFS and LAXS, 2.54(1) A˚ ,
	point to a six-coordinate hydrated lead(II) ion in hemidirected fashion
	with an unevenly distributed electron density.
	
	
	#why pb(II) is more dominant in environment than pb(IV):
	
	The tendency of the heavier main group elements to adopt an oxidation
	state two steps below the highest possible oxidation state has been
	attributed to the effect of the so-called “inert electron-pair”.
	This property was explained by the relativistic stabilization of
	the 6s orbital, caused by the direct relativistic effect and the
	presence of the filled 4f subshell.
	
	
	#The broad range of coordination numbers from 2 to 12 exhibited by
	lead(II), if counting all nearest neighbors, results in a large variety
	of configurations of its complexes and compounds
	
	
	#about inert electron-pair theory
	
	According to the valence bond theory, the inert electron-pair can
	either occupy a hybrid orbital formed by mixing the 6s and 6p orbitals
	on the metal ion and as such becoming stereochemically active, or
	be a pure s 2 electronpair and thereby stereochemically inactive.
	
	
	However, according to molecular orbital theory the classical conception
	of 6s/6p orbital hybridization on the lead(II) ion is regarded as
	incorrect. This is because the energy levels of these orbitals are
	too dissimilar, and the different spatial distribution of their corresponding
	wave functions.
	
	Instead, the stereochemical activity observed in lead(II) complexes
	should be seen as a result of an antibonding lead 6s-ligand np (6s/np)
	interaction
	
	which causes structural distortions to energetically minimize these
	unfavorable covalent interactions.
	
	
	Two general structural types of lead(II) complexes are identified,
	hemidirected and holodirected. In the former, the electron distribution
	around the
	
	metal ion is greatly unevenly distributed, caused by antibonding metal-ligand
	interactions creating a visual gap in the coordination sphere, while
	in the latter the electron distribution, as well as the coordination
	sphere, is symmetric.
	
	
	For 4- and 5-coordinate lead(II) complexes only hemidirected complexes
	are known, and for coordination numbers larger than eight no difference
	in ionic radius between hemi and holodirectionality can be distinguished.
	
	
	The wide bond distance distribution in the hemidirected complexes
	is well explained by the recent proposed MO theory where the metal-ligand
	
	bonds form antibonding covalent interactions.
	
	
	#lead(II) hydrolysis
	
	The primary products of hydrolysis are the mononuclear [Pb(OH)] +
	complex (pKa = 7.9) in dilute solutions and the tetranuclear [Pb4(OH)4]
	4+ complex in more concentrated ones.
	
	
	Also, the composition of the dominating polynuclear lead(II) hydrolysis
	complexes changes with increasing pH: [Pb4(OH)4] 4þ , [Pb3(OH)4]
	2þ , and
	
	[Pb6O(OH)6] 4þ , in the pH range 5-8.5, respectively.
	
	
	The lead(II) ion is weakly hydrated because of its low charge density.
	
	
	the expected holodirected Pb-O bond distance in six- and eight-coordination
	is 2.50 and 2.62 A˚, respectively, while the hemidirected Pb-O bond
	
	distance in six-coordination is 2.55 A˚.
	
	The experimental results together with the mean bond distance and
	the width of the bond distance distribution indicate that the hydrated
	lead(II) ion in aqueous solution is six-coordinate in hemidirected
	fashion.},

	the DFT-based interpretation of in situ FTIR spectra of the controversial
	binding form of weakly adsorbed carbonate on hydrated hematite nanoparticles

	the weakly adsorbed carbonate to an inner-sphere monodentate mononuclear
	complex. FTIR data and the â€œbond lengthâˆ’vibrational frequencyâ€�
	correlations established by DFT suggest that the adsorption affinity
	of ferrihydrite toward carbonate is lower than that of 7 nm hematite
	NPs. As opposed to the case of carbonate, the outer-sphere adsorption
	form of sulfate is demonstrated to be stable in the presence of hydronium.
	These findings have important implications for DFT modeling of the

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to characterize
	the microstructure of the interface between aqueous solutions and

	surfaces, each either neutral or negatively charged. The fully atomistic
	description of the rutile surface and its interactions with the fluid
	phase was based on ab initio calculations, while the aqueous phase
	was described by the SPC/E model and existing parametrizations for
	Rb+, Na+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Cl- ions. Formation of inner-sphere
	complexes of cations with surface oxygens was identified for all
	cations studied. On negatively charged surfaces, Zn2+ is shown to
	sorb at two bidentate sites, between a bridging and terminal oxygen,
	and between two terminal oxygens (hydroxylated surface only), while
	all other cations occupy a tetradentate site, in contact with two
	terminal and two bridging oxygens in adjacent rows on the crystal
	surface, and directly above an additional triply coordinated oxygen
	in the Ti−O surface plane. These differences in inner-sphere binding
	configuration appear to be related to the bare ionic radii of the
	cations. Simulation results agree very well with X-ray standing wave
	and crystal truncation rod studies of the inner-sphere adsorption
	sites of the cations Rb+ and Sr2+. MD and X-ray results for Zn2+
	adsorption are qualitatively consistent, but important differences
	in adsorption heights are discussed. Both MD simulations and X-ray
	studies indicate that, on rutile (110), interaction of Cl- with neutral

	is minimal. The hydroxylated surface gives better agreement with
	experiments than the nonhydroxylated surface and is therefore inferred
	to be the dominant surface in contact with aqueous solutions at ambient

	indicate that Sr2+ and Ca2+ also form outer-sphere species that are
	laterally ordered with respect to the crystal surface structure,
	though these are much less abundant than the inner-sphere species.
	At positively charged hydroxylated surfaces, MD simulations indicate
	Cl- adsorption in the tetradentate site 4.3 Å above the surface,
	with longer-range ordering of ions and water molecules than was observed
	on neutral or negatively charged surfaces. The adsorption geometries

  abstract = {Experimental determinations of the atomic structure of insulating
	oxide surfaces and metal/oxide interfaces are scarce, because surface
	science techniques are often limited by the insulating character
	of the substrate. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS), which
	is not subject to charge effects, can provide very precise information
	on the atomic structure of oxide surfaces: roughness, relaxation
	and reconstruction. It is also well adapted to analyze the atomic
	structure, the registry, the misfit relaxation, elastic or plastic,
	the growth mode and the morphology of metal/oxide interfaces during
	their growth, performed in situ. GIXS also allows the analysis of
	thin films and buried interfaces, in a non-destructive way, yielding
	the epitaxial relationships, and, by variation of the grazing incidence
	angle, the lattice parameter relaxation along the growth direction.
	On semi-coherent interfaces, the existence of an ordered network
	of interfacial misfit dislocations can be demonstrated, its Burger's
	vector determined, its ordering during in situ annealing cycles followed,
	and sometimes even its atomic structure can be addressed. Careful
	analysis during growth allows the modeling of the dislocation nucleation
	process.
	
	This review emphasizes the new information that GIXS can bring to
	oxide surfaces and metal/oxide interfaces by comparison with other
	surface science techniques. The principles of X-ray diffraction by
	surfaces and interfaces are recalled, together with the advantages
	and properties of grazing angles. The specific experimental requirements
	are discussed. Recent results are presented on the determination
	of the atomic structure of relaxed or reconstructed oxide surfaces.
	A description of results obtained during the in situ growth of metal
	on oxide surfaces is also given, as well as investigations of thick
	metal films on oxide surfaces, with lattice parameter misfit relaxed
	by an array of dislocations. Recent work performed on oxide thin
	films having important physical properties such as superconductivity
	or magnetism is also briefly reviewed.
	
	The strengths and limitations of the technique, such as the need for
	single crystals and surfaces of high crystalline quality are discussed.
	Finally, an outlook of future prospects in the field is given, such
	as the study of more complex oxide surfaces, vicinal surfaces, reactive
	metal/oxide interfaces, metal oxidation processes, the use of surfactants
	to promote wetting of a metal deposited on an oxide surface or the
	study of oxide/liquid interfaces in a non-UHV environment.},

	suggested that formation of a Fe(II) surface phase (adsorbed or precipitated)
	limited the extent of iron(III) oxide reduction. These results demonstrated
	explicitly that the rate and extent of microbial iron(III) oxide
	reduction is controlled by the surface area and site concentration
	of the solid phase. Strain BrY grew in media with synthetic goethite

	quantities of Fe(II) in anaerobic soil and subsurface environments
	where crystalline iron(III) oxides (e.g., goethite) are the dominant
	forms of Fe(III) available for microbial reduction. Results suggest

	in both water and sediment. Generally, As and Sb concns. in the water
	samples ranged from 0.90-8.25 ppm and 0.09-0.75 ppm resp. These values

	#INERT-PAIR EFFECT
	
	This term refers to the resistance of the pair of outer electrons
	on Pb(II) to removal or to participation in covalent bond formation
	or hydrogen bonding.
	
	It has been explained as a relativistic effect causing the 6s orbital
	to contract, thereby increasing the energy required to remove or
	interact with the 6s lone pair of electrons. On the other hand, the
	d and f orbitals are destabilized because they expand radially as
	a result of screening from nuclear attraction by the s and p electrons.
	The result is a stable, relatively inert outer lone pair of electrons.
	
	
	This lone pair of electrons can cause a nonspherical charge distribution
	around the Pb(II) cation, that is, the disposition of ligands around
	the cation results in an identifiable void. This gap in the coordination
	sphere has been considered evidence of a “stereochemically active
	lone pair of electrons” which
	
	probably takes up more space on a specific region of the surface of
	the coordination sphere than does a single bond.
	
	
	In this structure, all six Pb II-N distances are equal and the lone
	pair of electrons has no apparent directional effects on the angular
	distribution of the ligands or on the lead-ligand distances.
	
	
	When this Pb II-lp distance is large, the coordination is viewed as
	hemidirected because PbII-X bonds in one direction are very much
	shorter than those in the opposite direction. (even the ligands looks
	evenly distributing around the pb atom, take a look at scheme2)
	
	
	#electron transfer
	
	a greater transfer of electron density from the ligands to the lead
	as the electronegativity of the ligand decreases.The transfer of
	electrons is primarily into the 6p orbitals on the lead.
	
	The primary structural consequence of the greater lead p population
	is a decrease in the exterior X-PbII-X angle, suggesting some tendency
	toward a more tetrahedral (holodirected) arrangement of the ligands
	around the lead.
	
	The lone pair Pb(II) orbital consistently has greater p character
	when the ligands are charged.

	pollutants of high interest, however, the biogeochem. behavior of
	Sb is still largely unknown, esp. compared to other well-known toxic
	elements. In particular, questions remain about the availability
	of Sb to vascular plants. In this work, we focused on the following
	problems: (i) Sb uptake by plants; (ii) the availability of Sb to
	plants and (iii) variations in uptake and distribution of essential
	plant nutrients and trace elements resulting from bioaccumulation
	of Sb in Triticum aestivum (wheat) seedlings. The seedlings were
	either germinated or grown in media enriched with Sb. By the end
	of germination, concns. of Sb in the seedlings germinated in Sb-amended
	media increased significantly. Sb content was highest in the roots
	and lowest in the leaves of the seedlings. After transfer of the
	seedlings germinated in an Sb-free medium to Sb-enriched media, Sb
	concn. in the seedlings increased with time, esp. in the roots. Bioaccumulation
	of Sb influenced concns. of different macro- and trace elements in

	coordination chemistry of functional groups at water-substrate interface
	plays a major role in dictating surface reactivity
	
	
	Hematite structure
	
	Each six-coordinated iron site has three short Fe-O bonds (1.95A)
	and three long Fe-O bonds (2.11A)
	
	
	Constraint the fitting parameters:
	
	fractional z-coordinate for all 10 layers of the substrate
	
	x and y-fractional coordinates and occupancies were relaxed for only
	the top five layers of the substrate
	
	Debye-Waller factors for layers 4 and below were fixed to the bulk
	values
	
	oxygen atomic positions in layers 1 and 3 (or 3 and 5 for C-series)
	to maintain fourfold rotational symmetry about the central coordinating
	Fe
	
	
	Best fit model show:
	
	expansion of the layer 1–3 spacing (11 ± 3%) and the layer 4–5 spacing
	(14 ± 7%) and a contraction of layer 3–4 spacing (-11 ± 3%)
	
	The in-plane atomic coordinates show minimal displacements, especially
	for layer 3 and below.
	
	Consequently, the unit cell for the best-fit model has roughly 1.8
	H2O per unit cell.
	
	The best-fit CTR model resulted in an overall roughness parameter
	(b) of 0.12 ± 0.01,
	
	
	Two different domains
	
	the observation of partial occupancy suggests that the surface may
	be a mixed termination with the dominant proportion (~72%) having
	an Fe–O stoichiometry consistent with the C-series of models (layer
	2 vacancy) and a lesser proportion (~28%) of the hydroxylated ‘‘stoichiometric’’
	termination
	
	
	surface termination depends strongly on surface preparation conditions:
	
	low temperature annealing in UHV (below 600 K) results in a stoichiometric
	termination, 
	
	whereas higher temperature UHV annealing (673–1273 K) results in a
	partially reduced (2 · 1) termination (citation)
	
	CMP-prepared surface layer 2 Fe vacancy can be driven to a surface
	structure consistent with the stoichiometric termination (A-series)
	by annealing in air above 673 K
	
	
	Protonation of surface oxo:
	
	The Fe–IO bond length in the unrelaxed surface model is 2.11 A ˚ .
	This bond length would be expected to decrease in the absence of
	protonation
	
	to compensate for reduced coordination. The bestfit model resulted
	in a Fe–IO bond length of 2.18 ± 0.08A ˚ , which is within error
	of the unrelaxed surface bond length. Thus, the long Fe–IO bond suggests
	that this oxygen is protonated, either singly (i.e. hydroxyl) or
	doubly (i.e. a water molecule).
	
	All other Fe–O bond lengths (1.92 ± 0.02–2.12 ± 0.04 A ˚ ) are also
	similar to their bulk values (1.95–2.11A ˚ ), within the errors associated
	with the fit.
	
	possible protonation schemes: (H2O)2–(H2O)2–(H2O)2–X–(HO)2–Fe2–O2–R
	with four out of six oxygens per unit cell are possibly stable and
	the remaining two (i.e. IIIO) are undersaturated by approximately
	0.4 v.u.
	
	
	Probable hydrogen bonding network
	
	the most significant feature is that the bridging IIOH is donating
	a hydrogen bonds to the underlying IIIO while the terminal aquogroups
	are involved in in-plane donor–acceptor hydrogen bonding.
	
	The bond valence calculations for the proposed DFT model including
	the contribution of protons and hydrogen bonding show that IIIO (s
	= 1.9) and IOH2
	
	(Ps = 1.9) are saturated within 0.1 v.u., whereas IIOH (s = 1.6) is
	undersaturated. However, donor hydrogen bonding from the physisorbed
	water layer may potentially stabilize this group.
	
	
	pKa value
	
	The pKa values were calculated using the empirical model described
	by Hiemstra et al. 
	
	A simplified form of the Hiemstra et al. model [52] for our case can
	be written as pKa=19.8(2-sum(s))},

	IHSS humic acids. Our results imply that a significant part of Sb
	is likely to be bound with humic acids via hydroxy-carboxylic moieties,
	in the form of bidendate complexes. However, following the strong
	chemical affinity of SbIII for reduced sulfur, some undefined fraction
	of SbIII might also be bound to the minor thiol-bearing moieties

	has received extensive theoretical study, due to the importance of
	this interface in electrochemistry and other sciences. Such studies
	suggest that adjacent to the interface water is arranged in several
	layers, that the molecular arrangements in the inner layer is similar
	to bulk water, and that the inner-layer molecules have an oxygen-up
	(oxygen-down) average orientation for negative (positive) electrode
	charge (or, equivalently, potential). However, little of this has
	been verified by experimental measurements. In this paper we report
	surface X-ray scattering measurements of the water distribution perpendicular
	to a Ag(111)-electrolyte interface in 0.1M NaF at two potentials:
	+0.52 and −0.23 V from the potential of zero charge (PZC) on the
	electrode. We find that, first, the water is ordered in layers extending
	about three molecular diameters from the electrode. Second, the extent
	of ordering and the distance between the electrode and first water
	layer depend on potential, the latter being consistent with an oxygen-up
	(oxygen-down) average molecular orientation for negative (positive)
	electrode potential. Third, the inner water layer contains 1.55 ×
	1015 (at −0.23 V) and 2.6 × 1015 (at +0.52 V) water molecules per
	cm−2, remarkably more than expected from the bulk water density (i.e.,
	∼ 1.15 × 1015cm−2). Such a large compression shows that the molecular
	arrangements in the inner layer are significantly different from
	bulk, which has not been anticipated in current models of charged,
	aqueous interfaces. We give a qualitative explanation of this large
	density as resulting from the strong electric field at the charged
	Ag(111) electrode and present a tentative model of the molecular
	arrangements.},

	surface is dominated by two hydroxyl moieties—hydroxyls that are singly
	coordinated and doubly coordinated with Fe.
	
	
	 Introduction
	
	Hematite is a common and highly reactive environmental sorbent and
	thus plays an important role in contaminant sequestration and chemical
	speciation in
	
	groundwater aquifers and soils
	
	As a catalyst, hematite is used to convert ethyl benzene to styrene
	in the presence of steam [4], and for the oxidation of SO2, CO, ammonia,
	and propylene
	
	variations in hydroxylated surface structures among metal-oxides substrates
	are likely to be a dominant factor dictating differences in environmental
	reactivity
	
	
	Termination and hydrolation of hematite under different pO2 and pH2O
	
	exposing the a-Fe2O3(0001) surface to high oxygen partial pressures
	(pO2) leads to the formation of two chemically distinct domains [16,27,28].
	
	Based on the DFT calculations of Wang et al. [16] the two-domain structure
	was proposed to consist of the Fe-terminated (Fe–O3–Fe–R) and oxygenterminated
	(O3–Fe–Fe–R) stoichiometries.
	
	When exposed to water vapor at pressures exceeding a threshold of
	104Torr the clean a-Fe2O3(0001) surface becomes hydroxylated [29].
	
	Hydroxylation of the oxygen-terminated surface results in a stable
	(non-polar) configuration for corundum-type (0001) surfaces as observed
	for
	
	a-Al2O3(0001) (e.g., (HO)3–Al–Al–R) there is evidence from theory
	[17], scanning tunneling microscopy [31,32], and surface complexation
	modeling studies [33] indicating the Fe-termination or a hydroxylated
	Fe-termination, (HO)x–Fe–O3–R, may persist at high pH2O.
	
	However, an analogous Al-termination or hydroxylated Al-termination
	(e.g., (HO)x–Al–O3–R) has not been observed experimentally for the
	a-Al2O3(0001) surface under high water activity.
	
	
	Hematite crysatal structure
	
	The a-Fe2O3 structure (space group R3c) consists of a distorted hexagonally
	closest packed layer sequence of oxygen with iron occupying two thirds
	of the octahedral holes. This leads to two sets of Fe–O bond lengths;
	the Fe that is displaced in the positive direction along the c-axis
	has three short Fe–O bonds (1.95A ˚ ) to the oxygen layer above and
	three long Fe–O bonds (2.11A ˚ ) to the oxygen layer below.
	
	
	Difference between Al2O3 and Fe2O3
	
	The surface hydroxyl configuration proposed for the hydrated a-Al2O3(0001)
	is predicted to have a low affinity for binding aqueous metal ions
	
	While a similar argument would apply to the corresponding (HO)3–Fe–Fe–R
	termination of a-Fe2O3(0001), it has been observed that this surface
	is significantly more reactive with respect to adsorption of aqueous
	Pb(II)
	
	The UHV-prepared a-Fe2O3(0001) is also more reactive with respect
	to water vapor [29], with water dissociation and surface hydroxylation
	occurring
	
	at pH2O up to 4-orders of magnitude lower pressure than on a-Al2O3(0001).
	
	
	How to constrain fitting parameters
	
	the (1 · 1) p3 symmetry of the surface was maintained in the fit by
	fixing the in-plane coordinates of the Fe atoms at their bulk lattice
	positions and forcing the O3 layers to have the same z-displacement
	parameter while maintaining trigonal symmetry in-plane. All other
	fit parameters were floated independently.
	
	In-plane displacements were allowed within the first two oxygen layers,
	and z-displacements were allowed within the first 10 atomic layers.
	
	
	DFT results and CTR results
	
	Based on this comparison, the CTR results appear most consistent with
	a single-domain surface stoichiometry (assuming random partial occupancies)
	
	(OH)1.2–Fe0.4–H1.2O3–R, or a mixture of two distinct domains of (OH)3–Fe–H3O3–R
	and (OH)3–Fe–Fe–R.
	
	In the absence of water, the Fe–O3–Fe–R terminated surface is predicted
	to be most stable below a threshold pO2, above which the O3–Fe–Fe–R
	surface becomes lowest in energy
	
	When water is included in the system, however, surface hydroxylation
	results in the filling of open valencies and reduction in surface
	polarity, thus significantly lowering the surface free energies.
	
	
	Threshold of pH2O for Fe2O3 and Al2O3
	
	as pH2O increases above a threshold of approximately 5.0 · 1012mbar,
	the triply hydroxylated Fe-termination ((HO)3–Fe–H3O3–R) becomes
	favored over the partially hydroxylated surface (HO–Fe–HO3–R) or
	the clean Fe–O3–Fe–R surface (66.4meV/A˚ 2). This threshold is significantly
	lower than the pH2O threshold of 1.0 · 103mbar found to yield the
	analogous (HO)3–Al–H3O3–R structure on a-Al2O3(000 1)},

	values of 7.0 to 8.2. Over equilibration times of 15â€“111 h, we

	hydroxide coprecipitate with a hydrotalcite-type local structure.
	These conclusions are based on an analysis of first- and second-neighbor
	interatomic distances derived from EXAFS spectra collected under
	ambient conditions on wet samples. At low sorption densities the
	sorption mechanism involves a transformation from six-coordinated
	Znâ€“hexaaquo solution complexes (with an average Znâ€“O distance

	consistent with this reaction (z=a-aâ€²+b-bâ€²+4-câ€²-dâ€²), and
	with bond valence analysis falls in the range of 0 to 2 H+/Zn(II)
	when hydrolysis of the adsorbed Zn(II) complex is neglected. This
	interpretation suggests that proton release is likely a strong function
	of the coordination chemistry of the surface hydroxyl groups. At
	higher sorption densities (1.5 to 3.5 Î¼mol/m2), a high-amplitude,
	second-shell feature in the Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra
	indicates the formation of a three-dimensional mixed-metal coprecipitate,
	with a hydrotalcite-like local structure. Nitrate anions presumably
	satisfy the positive layer charge of the Al(III)â€“Zn(II) hydroxide
	layers in which the Zn/Al ratio falls in the range of 1 : 1 to 2
	: 1. Our results for the higher Î“-value sorption samples suggest
	that Znâ€“hydrotalcite-like phases may be a significant sink for

	at ambient conditions was studied by means of molecular dynamics
	simulations and X-ray crystal truncation rod experiments and interpreted
	with the help of the revised MUSIC model of surface protonation.
	The interactions of the metal oxide in the simulations were described
	by a recently developed classical force field based on the SPC/E
	model of water. Two extreme cases of completely hydroxylated and
	nonhydroxylated surfaces were considered along with a mixed surface
	with 50% dissociation. To study the dependence of the surface properties
	on pH, neutral and negatively charged variants of the surfaces were
	constructed. Axial and lateral density distributions of water for
	different types of surfaces were compared to each other and to experimental
	axial density distributions found by X-ray experiments. Although
	significant differences were found between the structures of the
	studied interfaces, the axial distances between Sn and O atoms are
	very similar and therefore could not be clearly distinguished by
	the diffraction technique. The explanation of structures observed
	in the density distributions was provided by a detailed analysis
	of hydrogen bonding in the interfacial region. It revealed qualitatively
	different hydrating patterns formed at neutral hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated
	surfaces and suggested a preference for the dissociative adsorption
	of water. At negatively charged surfaces, however, the situation
	can be reversed by the electric field stabilizing a hydrogen bond
	network similar to that found at the neutral nonhydroxylated surface.
	Comparison with previously studied rutile (α-TiO2) surfaces provided
	insight into the differences between the hydration of these two metal
	oxides, and an important role was ascribed to their different lattice
	parameters. A link to macroscopic properties was provided by the
	revised MUSIC surface protonation model. Explicit use of the Sn−O
	bond lengths based on ab initio calculations and H-bond configurations
	as inputs led to the prediction of a pH of zero net-proton induced
	surface charge (pHpzc) that agrees very well with those determined

  abstract = { Arsenic sorption onto iron oxide spinels such as magnetite may contribute
	to arsenic immobilization at redox fronts in soils, sediments, and
	aquifers, as well as in putative remediation and water treatment
	technologies. We have investigated As(V) speciation resulting from
	different sorption processes on magnetite nanoparticles, including
	both adsorption and precipitation, using X-ray absorption fine structure
	(XAFS) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XAFS
	results suggest that AsO4 tetrahedra form predominantly inner-sphere
	bidentate corner-sharing (2C) complexes and outer-sphere complexes
	on magnetite in the adsorption experiments. In the precipitation
	experiments, an increasing fraction of AsO4 tetrahedra appears to
	be incorporated in clusters having a magnetite-like local structure
	with increasing As loading, the remaining fraction of As being adsorbed
	at the surface of magnetite particles. In the sample with the highest
	As loading (15.7 Î¼mol/m2) XAFS data indicate that As(V) is fully
	incorporated in such clusters. Such processes help to explain the
	significantly higher arsenic uptake in precipitation samples compared
	to those generated in adsorption experiments. In addition, for the
	precipitation samples, TEM observations indicate the formation of
	amorphous coatings and small (âˆ¼3 nm) nanoparticles associated with
	larger (âˆ¼20â€“40 nm) magnetite nanoparticles, which are absent
	in the adsorption samples. These results suggest that As(V) could
	form complexes at the surfaces of the small nanoparticles and could
	be progressively incorporated in their structure with increasing
	As loading. These results provide some of the fundamental knowledge
	about As(V)-magnetite interactions that is essential for developing
	effective water treatment technologies for arsenic. },

	controlling the interaction between UO2 and MnO2, which are both
	poorly soluble minerals. A multi-chamber reactor with a permeable

	U(IV) with its adsorption and oxidation on MnO2. Continuously-stirred

	dissolution, but the degree of promotion leveled off once the MnO2:UO2

	suggested that U(VI) may passivate MnO2 surfaces. A conceptual model

  abstract = {Arsenate and silicate are tetrahedral anions that strongly sorb to
	positive Fe oxide surfaces over the pH range 2â€“7. Both are important
	agents for modification of Fe oxide surface reactivity, and notably
	passivate against other sorption reactions. Arsenate is a significant
	health hazard as a sorbed pollutant associated with acid mine drainage,
	while silicate is a common anion in natural solutions. Our aim is
	to understand the types of sorption complexes that form with these
	anions on different crystal faces, and whether polymerization occurs
	with the silicate units. Silicate polymerization could dramatically
	alter Fe oxide surface reactivity. The structural characterization
	is conducted using both grazing incidence extended X-ray absorption
	fine structure (GIEXAFS) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
	(SSRL) and the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), and surface
	diffraction (using crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis) at the
	Advanced Photon Source (APS). GIEXAFS yields interatomic distances
	from arsenic and silicon to their oxygen first neighbor shell and
	second Fe or other next neighbor shell, and thus allows identification
	of the local geometry of sorption. Polarized X-ray fine structure
	spectroscopy further allows determination of the orientation and
	density of the complexes on the various Fe surface planes. However,
	this information is incomplete as any response of the surface to
	sorption is not revealed, and hydrogen bonding and water molecule
	arrangement at the surface can be changed due to the sorption process.
	To access these we use CTR experiments and compare the results with
	samples without sorbed anions. GIEXAFS results for both hematite
	(0&#xa0;0&#xa0;0&#xa0;1) and ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) planes show arsenate sorbed
	in two ways: bidentate binuclear and bidentate mononuclear. Most
	of the latter type of sorption geometry appears to be present on
	surface step edges on the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface, while there is little
	or no such attachment to the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface terraces. These
	results appear consistent with preliminary structural models obtained
	by CTR work for the clean and sorbed wet hematite surfaces, and further
	analysis is in progress. In the case of silicate, strong changes
	in the CTR are observed indicating considerable surface interactions.
	CTR measurements of the silicate on the ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface of
	hematite suggest that a monodentate sorption geometry is more dominant
	than other possible sorption geometries. However GIEXAFS analysis
	done on analogous samples at the Si K-edge shows second shell contributions
	that are similar to amorphous silica, and are largely independent
	of sorption density. These results suggest that there are at least
	two kinds of silicate on the hematite surface: a chemically bound
	fraction present as a silicateâ€“Fe3+ octahedral complex, and an
	incoherent portion which is not detectable by the CTR measurements
	but appears to dominate the GIEXAFS results. The complexed silicate
	on the hematite ( 1 1 Â¯ 02 ) surface is linked by a single oxygen
	to surface Fe, i.e., a monodentate connection, with an interatomic
	Si-Fe distance close to those observed in the nontronite and acmite
	structures. This is the first evidence to our knowledge that identifies
	silicate as a well-defined sorption complex rather than only as an
	amorphous surface precipitate. More significantly, the monodentate
	complex is apparently favored over a more strongly bound bidentate
	complexation geometry, suggesting that polymerization at the interface
	may originate synchronously with sorption and be mitigated by the
	position of surface sites consistent with a polymerized network.
	These findings have important significance for the nature of passivation
	processes on Fe oxides and other important reactive natural surfaces.},

	origin, particularly in semiarid areas, (2) volcanic deposits, (3)
	geothermal systems, and (4) uranium and gold-mining areas. These
	findings are based on an extensive literature review, compilation
	of unpublished reports and data, and the review of data bases containing
	more than 7,000 analyses of ground-water samples for arsenic. In
	the first two environments, arsenic appears to be associated with
	sediments derived, in part, from volcanic rocks of intermediate to
	acidic composition. Dissolved arsenic concentrations in water from
	volcanic aquifers in the same regions, however, may be low (less

	solids, and sedimentary organic matter) that supply the dissolved
	arsenic have not been identified in most areas. Alluvial and lacustrine
	sedimentary deposits appear to be an important source of arsenic
	in volcanic areas (such as Lane County, Oregon) and in areas underlain
	by basin-fill deposits (such as Carson Desert in Nevada and the Tulare
	Lake basin in California). Mobilization of arsenic in sedimentary
	aquifers may be, in part, a result of changes in the geochemical
	environment due to agricultural irrigation. In the deeper subsurface,
	elevated arsenic concentrations are associated with compaction caused

	Ni(II) and Zn(II) adsorption and competition on goethite surfaces.
	The 2-pKa triple layer model successfully predicted adsorption in
	single adsorbate systems. The curvature in adsorption isotherms was
	accurately depicted using two types of sites:  high affinity and
	low affinity, and mononuclear bidentate surface complexes. A constrained
	set of parameters was found for each metal (log KL = −6.63 and log
	KH = −2.45 for Ni, log KL = −3.92 and log KH = 2.14 for Zn) that
	successfully described adsorption over a large range of experimental
	conditions, covering 6 to 7 orders of magnitude in concentration,
	ionic strength from 10-3 to 10-2, and environmentally relevant pH
	range between 4 and 6.5. Adsorption competition was predicted using
	the bidentate surface species with parameters calibrated using single
	adsorbate data. },

	environments are controlled, in part, by redox processes. Within
	soils and sediments, redox gradients resulting from mass transfer
	limitations lead to competitive reductionâ€“oxidation reactions that
	drive the fate of As. Accordingly, the objective of this study was
	to determine the fate and redox cycling of As at the interface of
	birnessite (a strong oxidant in soil with a nominal formula of MnOx,
	where x â‰ˆ 2) and dissimilatory As(V)-reducing bacteria (strong
	reductant). Here, we investigate As reductionâ€“oxidation dynamics
	in a diffusively controlled system using a Donnan reactor where birnessite
	and Shewanella sp. ANA-3 are isolated by a semipermeable membrane
	through which As migrates. Arsenic(III) injected into the reaction
	cell containing birnessite is rapidly oxidized to As(V). Arsenic(V)
	diffusing into the Shewanella chamber is then reduced to As(III),
	which subsequently diffuses back to the birnessite chamber, undergoing
	oxidation, and establishing a continuous cycling of As. However,
	we observe a rapid decline in the rate of As(III) oxidation owing
	to passivation of the birnessite surface. Modeling and experimental
	results show that high [Mn(II)] combined with increasing [CO32-]
	from microbial respiration leads to the precipitation of rhodochrosite,
	which eventually passivates the Mn oxide surface, inhibiting further
	As(III) oxidation. Our results show that despite the initial capacity
	of birnessite to rapidly oxidize As(III), the synergistic effect
	of intense As(V) reduction by microorganisms and the buildup of reactive
	metabolites capable of passivating reactive mineral surfacesâ€”here,
	birnessiteâ€”will produce (bio)geochemical conditions outside of
	those based on thermodynamic predictions. },

	As(III) oxidation by birnessite, a layered Mn-dioxide mineral. Edge-sharing

	exhibited stronger adsorption affinity than Mn(III) sites for both

	and slower electron transfer rates with adsorbed As(III). Results
